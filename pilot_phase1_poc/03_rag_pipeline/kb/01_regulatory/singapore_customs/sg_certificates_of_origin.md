# Singapore Certificates of Origin

## Overview

A Certificate of Origin (CO) is a trade document that identifies the origin of goods. It is essential for customs clearance and may determine the duty rate applicable to imported goods.

## Types of Certificates

### Non-Preferential Certificate of Origin (Ordinary CO)

An ordinary Certificate of Origin, also known as a non-preferential CO, is a trade document that helps to identify the origin of the good for commercial purposes.

**Used for:**
- General trade documentation
- Countries without FTA with Singapore
- Commercial requirements

### Preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO)

Preferential COs allow buyers to claim reduced or zero customs duties under Free Trade Agreements.

**Three issuance types:**
1. **Certification by Singapore Customs** - Official CO issued via TradeNet
2. **Origin declarations by Approved/Certified Exporters** - Self-certification by qualified companies
3. **Self-certification declarations** - Under specific FTA provisions

## Issuing Organizations

### Ordinary COs
Singapore Customs and five authorized entities issue ordinary COs:

| Organization | Abbreviation |
