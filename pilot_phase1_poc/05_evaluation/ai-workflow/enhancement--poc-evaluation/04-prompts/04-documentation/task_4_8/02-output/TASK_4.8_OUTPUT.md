# Task 4.8 Output — Lessons Learned

**Status**: Complete
**Date**: 2026-02-10

## File Created

`reports/lessons_learned.md` — Full 4-week retrospective with technical lessons, process insights, and actionable improvements.

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Technical section covers all major tech choices (ChromaDB, Groq, embeddings, chunking, hybrid architecture, evaluation harness)
- [x] Process section covers AI workflow pattern (prompt → review → execute, Claude Code autonomy, TDD, documentation timing)
- [x] "Do differently" section is substantive and specific (9 actionable items across architecture, tools, process, scope)
- [x] Organized chronologically (W1 ingestion, W2 RAG, W3 optimization, W4 evaluation)
- [x] Includes specific data points and examples (hit rates, chunk counts, failure counts, citation accuracy progression)

## Document Structure

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Executive Summary | 1 paragraph — 4-week sprint, outcomes, purpose |
| Technical Lessons | 4 subsections (W1-W4), each with "what worked" and "what caused friction" |
| Process Lessons | AI workflow, Claude Code partnership, TDD, documentation timing, tracking overhead |
| What We'd Do Differently | 9 specific items: confidence calibration, citation post-processing, evaluation methodology, embedding benchmarking, structured output, tracking consolidation, smoke evaluation, PDF scope, multi-turn design |
| Key Takeaways | 7 distilled principles |
