LCL, however, requires more handling, as the container is opened and consolidated at the origin and destination.\n\n### When to Choose Each\n\n*   **Choose FCL**:\n    *   When shipping large or heavy volumes of cargo.\n    *   When requiring a high level of security and reduced handling.\n    *   When the cargo is fragile or requires special care.\n*   **Choose LCL**:\n    *   When shipping smaller volumes of cargo.\n    *   When budget is a concern, as LCL is often cheaper.\n    *   When flexibility in delivery times is not a priority.\n\n[Sea Freight Booking Procedure > Container Options]",

        "answer": "**Maersk and ONE Service Comparison**\n\nMaersk and ONE (Ocean Network Express) are two major container shipping lines that operate in the global market. While both offer container shipping services, there are key differences between them.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n*   **Network and Routes**: Maersk has a more extensive global network, with a presence in over 120 countries and a wide range of routes. ONE, on the other hand, has a more focused network, with a strong presence in the Asia-Europe and Asia-North America trades.\n*   **Service Frequency and Reliability**: Maersk is known for its high service frequency and reliability, with an average of 20-30 sailings per week on major trade lanes. ONE also offers frequent sailings, but its network is more concentrated in specific regions.\n*   **Container Capacity and Types**: Maersk has a larger container fleet, with over 3.5 million TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) in its fleet. ONE has a smaller fleet, but it offers a range of container types, including refrigerated and specialized containers.\n*   **Tariffs and Pricing**: Maersk and ONE have different tariff structures and pricing models. Maersk offers a range of pricing options, including spot rates, contract rates, and value-added services. ONE also offers competitive pricing, but its tariffs are generally lower than Maersk's.\n*   **Service Features and Add-ons**: Both Maersk and ONE offer a range of service features and add-ons, including customs clearance, insurance, and logistics services. However, Maersk has a more extensive range of services, including its Maersk Flow supply chain visibility platform.\n\n**Source:** [Maersk Service Summary > Additional Services] and [ONE Service Overview > Key Features]\n\nPlease note that these differences are based on general information and may not reflect the specific services and offerings of Maersk and ONE in your region or for your specific needs. For more detailed information, please consult the official websites of Maersk and ONE or contact their customer service teams directly.",
