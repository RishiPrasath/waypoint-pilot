### UNDERSTANDING THE HARMONIZED SYSTEM

The language of international trade

Used by more than 200 economies and
Customs or Economic Unions

Assigns a class to all physical goods
moving across borders

Enables governments to apply border
treatments of goods (taxation, restrictions,
prohibitions, facilitation measures, etc..) at HS
grouping levels, simplifying application and
the ability of trade to understand and comply

Provides accurate data on what is being
traded internationally

Managed by the 163 Contracting
Serves as the basis for trade negotiations
Parties to the HS Convention

### WHAT IS THE HARMONIZED SYSTEM?

The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (popularly known as the Harmonized
System or the HS) was designed and developed as a "core" system so that countries adopting it could
make further subdivisions beyond six-digit HS codes according to their particular needs. Customs
tariffs and statistical nomenclatures for the import and export of goods are based on this instrument.

Today more than 200 economies and Customs or Economic Unions use the HS.

### CLASSIFYING A COMMODITY INTO A GROUP AND GIVING IT NUMBERS AS NAMES

The HS is a structured
nomenclature which enables
all physical goods moving
across borders to be assigned
to a class in a uniform manner
all over the world. It is a
taxonomic system comprising
a series of 4-digit headings
for general classes of goods,
most of which are further
subdivided into 5- and 6-digit
subheadings for more specific
classes of goods.

### HEADINGS 08.08 AND 08.13 IN THE HS 2022

08.08 Apples, pears and quinces, fresh

0808.10 Apples
0808.30 Pears
0808.40 Quinces

08.13 Fruit, dried, other than that of headings 08.01
to 08.06; mixtures of nuts or dried fruits of this
Chapter

0813.10 Apricots
0813.20 Prunes
0813.30 Apples
0813.40 Other fruit
0813.50 Mixtures of nuts or dried fruits of this Chapter

### PROVIDING ACCURATE DATA ON WHAT IS BEING TRADED INTERNATIONALLY

Putting individual goods into classes enables governments to collect trade data. For trade beyond the
imports/exports of one Customs union or one country, the comparison of data relies on classification
at the six-digit level, i.e., at the level provided by the HS.

### ALLOWING FOR DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT AT BORDER

The HS provides a common framework that allows governments to apply border measures
consistently and helps businesses understand how their goods will be treated at the border.

It is particularly used for:

   - revenue collection -- the assigning of different levels of duties and/or indirect taxes
reflecting the priorities;

   - the application of non-revenue measures - e.g. certification requirements or
facilitation requirements for highly perishable product groups;

   - restrictions -- putting controls or requirements on goods;

   - trade remedies and protective measures -- the application of anti-dumping or
countervailing duties, quotas, etc.;

   - trade agreements and preferential treatment;

   - trade sanctions;

   - origin determination - applying rules of origin by reference to HS product categories
and, where relevant, through a change in tariff classification.

### A LIVING LANGUAGE

The HS is reviewed every five-years usually. If a Contracting Party identifies changes that it believes
are needed, or has accepted a proposal from a national industry representative seeking changes,
then the government concerned sends a proposal to the WCO Secretariat for presentation to the
Harmonized System Committee (HSC) and its Review Sub-Committee (RSC). This can also happen
via an intergovernmental organization.

### EVOLVING WITH TRADE

Treating goods as individual items and given common names worked when there were only a
relatively few, simply defined commodities and their only use was national revenue collection. But
the system became unsustainable in the 19th century and some governments started switching their
alphabetical list of goods to a nomenclature based on systematic classification.

The problem was that they all had their own system, and trade operators had to adapt to each
separately. This also complicated the work of statisticians at a time when the demand for detailed
information on trade, including on international trade patterns, had grown.

The idea of developing an international nomenclature was discussed as early as 1889, which today
has grown to become the HS.
