**Instant Maersk.com Amendment for General and FMC SPOT Bookings**

We are pleased to announce a market leading change with our online experience with your SPOT, non- contractual

FCL shipments. Effective 24th March 2023, we have enabled instant amendments for your Maersk SPOT shipments

(both general and FMC), to give you upfront visibility on the applicable freight rates, applicable fees, along with

available sailing schedules.

With all information shown and collected upfront (digital signature for FMC online shipments), Maersk.com will

then process your amendments to return a faster revised booking confirmation to the booked by and/or requestor

email addresses. For full detail on benefit and change in experience, please refer to the details below.

**Improved Customer Experience for All SPOT Amendments:**

   - Both FMC and Non-FMC SPOT shipments can be amended instantly online, 24/7 round the clock (subject

to stage of container movement, refer scenario table below)

   - Real time space and equipment checks to show only sailings which Maersk can support

   - Upfront freight rates (if shipment subject to re-rating when schedule changed by customer)

   - Upfront fees shown, determined based on departure date (amendment, cancellation, no show fee

reflected in 'Select Sailing' page -- 'Price Breakdown' dropdown)

   - Reduced time for revised booking confirmation sent to booked by party and/or requestor

   - All price owner/booked by parties in shipment may amend SPOT on Maersk.com, regardless of initial

booking channel (Maersk.com, MyMaersk, EDI, INTTRA, etc)

**Benefit with New FMC SPOT Amendment Journey:**

   - Online amendment journey for SPOT FMC will show respective amendment or no-show fee, depending on

whether cancelled 7 days or less before ETD, respectively

   - Hence, customer no longer has to cancel and rebook if they wish to amend the booking

   - Intuitive journey for customer to give digital signature and other necessary information for FMC re-filling

(as per US regulation for FMCs), to proceed with FMC SPOT amendment

For full list of types of amendment now supported online, please refer to the table below, which follows the stages

of container movement for your shipment.

For amendment requests not supported online, Maersk.com fields will be greyed out and return an error message

accordingly. Adding/removing rollable from SPOT is not supported on Maersk.com yet; customers may inform

customer service only if they need to add rollable to their SPOT booking (at least 7 days prior ETD).
