# Filter out the noise
## With Pull Notifications

### Choose notifications that are important to you

Multiple communications in a day make it difficult to focus on the important tasks. Maersk's pull
notification feature lets you choose the exact events and the frequency of their alerts to you.

### You can stay up to date on:

New port and
terminal changes

New vessel and
voyage changes

New departure

dates

New arrival

dates

That's not all - you can also set the frequency of these notifications.

## Step-by-step guide To your custom notifications
### Setting up a new notification Step 1

Click on " Account" in the top right corner of the home page and Login.

### Step 2

Click on "Profile" located at the top right corner of the page and select Notifications..

### Step 3

Click Create new notification and select the type of notification you want to subscribe to -- Transport
plan changes, Bill of lading or Arrival notice.

### Step 4

Within each notification type, you have several filters to choose from. e.g. Under Transport plan
changes you can decide the gap in arrival or departure dates before we notify you.
You can also choose notifications for vessel, voyage, port or terminal changes, even if the schedule
is on track.

### **Step 5**

**Next, you can fill in the desired recipient's email address and the preferred language,**
**along with the days of the weeks or time intervals.**

### Step 6 - Additional filters

There's a lot more to choose from. You can refine your notifications based on the location if you want
to be informed only about the shipments going to or coming from one or more countries or corridors.
You may also set your notifications based on the roles or receive notifications only for the bookings
submitted by a specific email address.

Click on "SUBMIT" when you are satisfied with your filters and you will have set a new custom
notification.

### Editing a custom notification Step 1

You can edit or delete a custom notification from the Notifications page.
Click on "Manage" in the main menu and select "Notifications".

### Step 2
