## Overview

A Certificate of Origin (CO) is a trade document that identifies the origin of goods. It is essential for customs clearance and may determine the duty rate applicable to imported goods.

## Types of Certificates

### Non-Preferential Certificate of Origin (Ordinary CO)

An ordinary Certificate of Origin, also known as a non-preferential CO, is a trade document that helps to identify the origin of the good for commercial purposes.

**Used for:**
- General trade documentation
- Countries without FTA with Singapore
- Commercial requirements

### Preferential Certificate of Origin (PCO)

Preferential COs allow buyers to claim reduced or zero customs duties under Free Trade Agreements.

**Three issuance types:**
1. **Certification by Singapore Customs** - Official CO issued via TradeNet
2. **Origin declarations by Approved/Certified Exporters** - Self-certification by qualified companies
3. **Self-certification declarations** - Under specific FTA provisions

## Issuing Organizations

## Non-Preferential Rules of Origin

For goods not seeking preferential tariff treatment, Singapore origin criteria require goods to be either:

**(a) Wholly obtained** — wholly grown or produced entirely in Singapore; or

**(b) Substantially transformed** in Singapore by meeting any of these criteria:

| Method | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Local Content Rule | Minimum 25% local content based on ex-factory price |
| Change in Tariff Classification | Change at the 6-digit level (Change in Tariff Sub-Heading) |
| Chemical Reaction Rule | Only for products under HS Chapters 27-40 |

Goods that have only undergone minimal processing (e.g., simple packaging, sorting, washing, labelling) do not qualify as Singapore-originating.

### Local Content Calculation

```
Local Content = (Local Raw Materials + Direct Labour Cost + Direct Overhead Cost) / Ex-factory Price × 100%
```

## Preferential Rules of Origin — Key Methods

For goods seeking preferential tariff treatment under FTAs, the three main origin criteria are:

### Change in Tariff Classification (CTC) Method
Requires that non-originating materials undergo sufficient processing to result in a change in tariff classification. CTC criteria vary by FTA — may require change at Chapter (CC), Heading (CTH), or Sub-heading (CTSH) level.

### Regional Value Content (RVC) Method
Requires that a specified percentage of the good's value originates from FTA member countries. Common thresholds: 35-45% depending on FTA.

### Process Rule Method
Requires specific manufacturing operations to be performed. Used for certain products like textiles, chemicals, and electronics where CTC and RVC methods may be insufficient.

### Key Flexibilities
- **De Minimis**: Allows a small percentage (typically 10%) of non-originating materials that do not meet CTC requirements
- **Accumulation**: Allows origin to be cumulated across FTA partner countries

## ASEAN-Wide Self-Certification (AWSC) Scheme

The AWSC allows **Certified Exporters (CEs)** to self-certify the origin of their goods without obtaining a Certificate of Origin from the issuing authority.

### Key Definitions (ATIGA Annex 8)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Certified Exporter (CE)** | An exporter duly authorised to make an Origin Declaration on the origin of goods exported |
| **Competent Authority** | Government authority of the exporting member state designated to authorise CEs |
| **Origin Declaration** | A declaration on origin made by a CE in accordance with Rule 12B |
| **Proof of Origin** | A document certifying goods meet the Rules of Origin (either Form D or Origin Declaration) |
| **e-Form D** | Electronic Certificate of Origin transmitted via ASEAN Single Window (ASW) |
| **Back-to-back Proof of Origin** | Proof issued by an intermediate exporting member state based on original proof from first exporting state |
| **Issuing Authority** | Government authority designated to issue Certificate of Origin (Form D) |

### How AWSC Works

1. **Exporter applies** to become a Certified Exporter with their national Competent Authority
2. **Competent Authority approves** and assigns a CE authorisation number
3. **CE makes Origin Declaration** on commercial documents (invoice, delivery note, etc.)
4. **Declaration includes**: CE authorisation number, HS code, origin criteria, and ASEAN member state of origin
5. **Importing customs** accepts the Origin Declaration as proof of origin for preferential tariff treatment

### Verification Procedures

- **Retroactive check** (Rule 18): Importing country can request verification from exporting country's issuing authority
- **Verification visit** (Rule 19): Importing country can conduct on-site verification in the exporting country
- Both procedures apply to Form D and Origin Declarations issued under AWSC

### Requirements to Become a Certified Exporter (CE)

An exporter must apply in writing or electronically to the Competent Authority and meet these conditions:

| # | Requirement |
|---|-------------|
| (a) | Duly registered in accordance with laws of the exporting member state |
| (b) | Authorised signatories must know and understand ATIGA Rules of Origin |
| (c) | Satisfactory level of export experience per domestic laws |
| (d) | No record of Rules of Origin fraud |
| (e) | Good compliance as measured by risk management of the Competent Authority |
| (f) | Traders must have a "manufacturer's declaration" indicating product origin and manufacturer cooperation in verification |
| (g) | Sound bookkeeping and record-keeping system |

### CE Obligations

- Grant Competent Authority access to records and premises for monitoring
- Make ODs only for goods the CE is authorised for and has origin proof documents
- Continue to comply with CE status conditions
- Cooperate in retroactive checks and verification visits
- Accept full responsibility for all Origin Declarations, including misuse
- Promptly inform Competent Authority of any changes to registered information
- Maintain records for at least **3 years** from the date of making the declaration

### OD vs e-Form D vs Paper Form D

| Feature | Origin Declaration (OD) | e-Form D / Paper Form D |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Who issues** | Certified Exporter (CE) | Issuing Authority |
| **Time to issue** | Very quick | Longer |
| **ROO knowledge required** | Extensive knowledge required | Some knowledge required |
| **Compliance obligations** | Per ATIGA OCP Rule 12A(4) | Submit supporting documents per ATIGA OCP Rule 5 |
| **Direct costs** | No direct costs | Some administrative costs |
| **Can be on commercial docs** | Yes (invoice, billing statement, delivery order, packing list) | No (separate form) |

CEs may choose to use any combination of AWSC OD, paper Form D, or e-Form D.

### Origin Declaration (OD) Format

The OD must include the following fields (indicative format — CEs may use any format containing required information):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name of Products | Product description |
| HS Code | 6-digit HS or 8-digit AHTN code |
| Origin conferring criterion | "WO" (wholly obtained), RVC percentage (e.g. "40%"), CTC rule (e.g. "CTH"), "SP" (specific processes), or combination (e.g. "CTSH+35%") |
| FOB value | Required when RVC origin criterion is used |
| Quantity of goods | Quantity with units |
| Trademark | If applicable |
| CE Authorisation Code | Format: 0000/XXXX |
| Country of Origin | ASEAN member state |

For **back-to-back OD**, additional fields required: Country of origin of first exporting country, original Proof of Origin reference number and date, and CE authorisation code of first exporting country.

### Minor Discrepancies in Proof of Origin

The following discrepancies are considered minor and should not cause rejection of a Proof of Origin:

| # | Discrepancy |
|---|-------------|
| 1 | Spelling and/or typing errors in the Proof of Origin |
| 2 | Size of tick marks and execution (manual or typewritten), including crossed instead of ticked |
| 3 | Slight discrepancies in authorized signature vs. authorized list of signatories |
| 4 | Different units of measurement in POO vs. supporting documents (invoices/packing list) |
| 5 | Minor differences in A4 paper size of Form D |
| 6 | Minor discrepancies in ink colour (black or blue) on Form D |
| 7 | Slight differences in description of goods in POO vs. supporting documents |
| 8 | Slight differences in goods description between AWSC CE Database and OD, provided keywords of registered goods are reflected |

### AWSC Key FAQs

**Q: Must the importer have CE status to benefit from AWSC?**
No, CE status is only required for the exporter.

**Q: Can a freight forwarder sign the OD on behalf of the CE?**
Yes, if nominated by the CE as an authorised signatory, subject to each AMS's domestic laws.

**Q: Can an OD be on a commercial invoice?**
Yes, the OD can be on the commercial invoice or other commercial documents (billing statement, delivery order, packing list), provided all required data is included. Other commercial documents may only be used if the invoice is not available at time of export.

**Q: Does the OD replace Form D?**
No. CEs may choose to use AWSC OD, paper Form D, or e-Form D — or any combination.

**Q: What happens if an incorrect OD is issued?**
May result in withdrawal of CE authorisation. Additional penalties follow each AMS's domestic laws.

**Q: Can a CE issue a back-to-back OD?**
Yes, in accordance with Rule 11 (Back-to-Back Proof of Origin) of the ATIGA OCP.

### AWSC Implementation
- Implemented across all 10 ASEAN member states since **20 September 2020**
- Provides faster, lower-cost alternative to obtaining Form D from issuing authority
- Particularly beneficial for frequent exporters with established trade patterns
- As of September 2020: 505 CEs registered under 1st SCPP, 154 CEs under 2nd SCPP
