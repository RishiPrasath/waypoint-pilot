## Overview

All goods imported into Singapore are subject to Goods and Services Tax (GST) at the prevailing rate.

**Current GST Rate**: 9% (effective 1 January 2024)

## GST Calculation Methods

GST is calculated based on one of two methods:

### Method 1: Customs Value Plus Duties
GST = Prevailing GST rate × (Customs value + All applicable duties)

### Method 2: Last Selling Price Plus Duties
Used when there have been multiple sales and the final buyer is declaring the payment permit.

GST = Prevailing GST rate × (Last selling price + All applicable duties)

## Calculation Examples

### For Non-Dutiable Goods

**Formula**: GST payable = 9% × (Customs value or Last Selling Price)

**Example:**
- Company purchases vitamins at S$900 FOB
- Freight and insurance costs: S$100
- Resells for S$1,500 before arrival
- GST = 9% × S$1,500 = **S$135**

### For Dutiable Goods

**Formula**: GST payable = 9% × (Customs value or Last Selling Price + Duties payable)

**Example:**
- Motor car valued at S$101,000
- Excise duty at 20%: S$20,200
- GST = 9% × (S$101,000 + S$20,200) = 9% × S$121,200 = **S$10,908**

## GST Exemptions and Relief Schemes

### Exemptions

### Relief Schemes
The following schemes may provide GST relief:
- Major Exporter Scheme (MES)

## Payment Methods

- Inter-Bank GIRO (IBG) - recommended for regular importers
- Direct payment at time of permit application

## Key Points
