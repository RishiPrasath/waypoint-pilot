##### 1. INTRODUCTION

The establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015
is a major milestone in the regional economic integration agenda in
ASEAN, offering opportunities in the form of a huge market of US$ 2.6
trillion and over 622 million people.

The AEC Blueprint 2025, adopted by the ASEAN Leaders at the 27th
ASEAN Summit on 22 November 2015 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
provides broad directions through strategic measures for the AEC from
2016 to 2025. The AEC Blueprint 2025 is aimed towards achieving the
vision of having an AEC by 2025 that is highly integrated and cohesive;

competitive, innovative and dynamic; with enhanced connectivity

**5**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

and sectoral cooperation; and a more resilient, inclusive, and peopleoriented, people-centred community, integrated with the global
economy.

The AEC Blueprint 2025 sets out the strategic measures under each of
the five characteristics of AEC 2025. To operationalise the Blueprint's
implementation, these strategic measures have been elaborated in
and implemented through the work plans of various sectoral bodies in
ASEAN.

The implementation of AEC Blueprint 2015 measures relating to tariff
elimination in accordance with the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement
(ATIGA) and trade facilitation measures have contributed to the greater
free flow of goods. In AEC 2025, ASEAN will continue to reduce or
eliminate border and behind-the-border regulatory barriers that impede
trade, so as to achieve competitive, efficient, and seamless movement
of goods within the region.

To realise the AEC 2025 vision, the Strategic Action Plan (SAP) 20162025 for trade in goods continues to strengthen the single market
and production base where the free flow of goods must remain as the
fundamental goal. ASEAN will aim to achieve more integrated trade
regimes, eliminate the remaining obstacles to regional trade and
promote a rules-based system to enable businesses to benefit the
most from ATIGA.

The AWSC Scheme is under the strategic measure "Simplify and
strengthen the implementation of the rules of origin", with the **Specific**
**Action Lines** 3.2.3 (Realisation of ASEAN-wide Self-Certification).

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

##### 2. THE ASEAN-WIDE SELF-CERTIFICATION (AWSC)

2.1. JOURNEY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AWSC

The origin self-certification initiative was first introduced at the 23 [rd]
AFTA Council Meeting in 2009 with the endorsement of the "Work Plan
Towards the Operationalisation of Self-Certification". As the name itself
indicates, exporters, traders, and manufacturers who demonstrated
their sound knowledge and capability of compliance with the origin
requirements would be authorised to self-certify the origin of goods
in lieu of applying for a conventional Certificate of Origin (CO) which
would be issued by issuing authorities. As the mechanism had never
been implemented in ASEAN and to pilot the operation with a view to
ensuring a certain level of comfort, particularly the risk management
and the confidence in implementing the self-certification, ASEAN
Member States (AMS) agreed to implement two Self-Certification Pilot
Projects (SCPPs).

The 1 [st] SCPP was signed on 30 August 2010 by Brunei Darussalam,
Malaysia and Singapore for the implementation on 1 November 2011.
Three other AMS subsequently joined the pilot project, namely Thailand
(28 October 2011), Cambodia (7 July 2015) and Myanmar (1 June
2016). By September 2020, 505 companies have been registered as
Certified Exporters (CEs) under this scheme. On this pilot project, both
manufacturers and traders are able to make out invoice declarations
on any commercial documents. The project also allows the third party
invoicing.

**7**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

Following the success of the 1 [st] SCPP, the 2 [nd] SCPP was signed by
Indonesia, Lao PDR, and the Philippines on 29 August 2012 and
implemented on 1 January 2014, followed by the accession of Viet
Nam and Thailand on 19 December 2014 and 1 May 2015, respectively.
By September 2020, 154 CEs joined this mechanism. Unlike the 1st
SCPP, the 2 [nd] pilot project only allows manufacturers to make out
declarations on invoices with more required information, while the third
party invoicing is not included.

Since the SCPPs only applied to participating AMS with different
Operational Certification Procedures (OCPs), there was a need
to create a region-wide system. To do so, 10 AMS signed the First
Protocol to amend the ATIGA on 22 January 2019. The ATIGA OCP was
subsequently amended in September 2019, merging the provisions
under the two SCPPs. The First Protocol was ratified by all 10 AMS
and entered into force on 20 September 2020. With the implementation
of the AWSC, both SCPPs are subsequently terminated. CEs are now
able to make out the Origin Declaration (OD) to all AMS.

2.2. THE AWSC

AWSC is a trade facilitation initiative which allows CEs in all AMS
to self-certify the origin of their exports to avail of preferential tariffs
under the ATIGA. Instead of applying for a CO Form D to an issuing
authority, a CE is able to make out an OD on a commercial invoice or
other commercial documents such as billing statement, delivery order,
or packing list. [1]

1 For more details, please refer to Rule 12B (2) of the ATIGA Operational Certification Procedures (OCP).

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

2.3. BENEFITS OF THE AWSC

More benefits of AWSC would be provided to the private and public
sectors. In terms of utilisation of ATIGA's commitments, the AWSC
encourages traders who are reluctant to apply for the paper-based
COs for the products which have low MFN tariff rates, which may
result in low margins as the benefits brought by the tariff preferences
fail to cover the administrative costs of application. The scheme also
significantly simplifies the origin certification in the ATIGA which will
substantially facilitate and promote trade across the region.

For exporters, the AWSC reduces their workload, administrative
burden, and costs of doing business. CEs no longer need to prepare
and submit supporting documents to apply for CO on their registered
goods. Furthermore, they do not have to visit the issuing authorities'
offices to submit, follow up and receive their paper-based Form D,
which may discourage those who are located far away from issuing
authority offices. Besides a sharp decrease in the application cost,
the AWSC reduces time for processing shipments, which may be
associated with storage, demurrage and detention fees. Altogether,
CEs are encouraged to trade more efficiently, gain more profit, and
generate more jobs.

The AWSC also reduces administrative burden on Issuing Authorities
since exporters who have been accorded with CE status can selfcertify their goods.

2.4. REQUIREMENTS TO BECOME A CERTIFIED EXPORTER (CE)
UNDER THE AWSC

As provided by Rule 1 of the ATIGA OCP, a CE means an exporter duly
authorised to make out an OD on the origin of a good exported.

As required by Rule 12A (1), an exporter must apply in writing or
electronically and offer to the satisfaction of the Competent Authority

**10**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the goods for
which an Origin Declaration was made out. The Competent Authority
may grant the status of CE subject to any conditions which they
consider appropriate, including in any case the following:

(a) The exporter is duly registered in accordance with the laws and
regulations of the exporting Member State;

(b) The exporter must undertake to ensure that the authorised
signatories responsible for making out the Origin Declarations, in
the undertaking, know and understand the Rules of Origin as laid
down in the Agreement;

(c) The exporter should have a satisfactory level of experience in
export in accordance with the laws and regulations of the exporting
Member State;

(d) The exporter has no record of any Rules of Origin fraud, in
accordance with the laws and regulations of the exporting Member
State;

(e) The exporter must have a good compliance measured by risk
management of the Competent Authority of the exporting Member
State;

(f) The exporter, in the case of a trader, must have a "manufacturer's
declaration" indicating the origin of the product to be subject to
self-certification and readiness of the manufacturer to cooperate in
retroactive check and verification visit should the need arise;

(g) The exporter must have a sound bookkeeping and record-keeping
system, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the
exporting Member State.

**11**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

**Figure 2.** Summary of Conditions for granting CE status

Apart from the aforementioned conditions, other specific requirements
could be requested by each AMS.

Upon successful application, the Competent Authority shall grant the
CE a written authorisation, including an authorisation code which is

**12**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

a requirement for making out an OD. Member States shall promptly
include the information on the authorisation granted in the ASEANwide Self-Certification database, in conformity with Rule 2(4).

2.5. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CEs

CEs are able to make out ODs and once the ODs are accepted by
the Customs authorities of the importing AMS, the originating goods
supported by such ODs are eligible for ATIGA preferential tariff
treatment.

As required by Rule 12 A (4), a CE shall have the following obligations:

(a) grant the Competent Authority access to records and premises
for the purpose of monitoring the use of authorisation and of the
verification of the correctness of declarations made out. The records
and accounts must allow for the identification and verification of
the originating status of goods for which an Origin Declaration was
made out, during at least three (3) years from the date of making
out the declaration in accordance with the laws and regulations of
the exporting Member State; [2]

(b) make out Origin Declarations only for goods for which the CE has
been authorised to make out an Origin Declaration and for which
the CE has all appropriate documents proving the originating status
of the goods concerned at the time of making out the declaration;

(c) Continue to comply with the conditions set out in Paragraph 2 of
Rule 12 A (Certified Exporter) of the OCP;

2 For more details about record keeping requirements, please refer to Rule 17 of the ATIGA OCP.

**13**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

(d) cooperate in retroactive checks and verification visits;

(e) accept full responsibility for all Origin Declarations made, including
any misuse; and

(f) promptly inform the Competent Authority of any changes related to
the information submitted under Rule 2(4) of this Annex.

It is further highlighted that each AMS may require different or more
obligations for CEs.

##### 3 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AWSC

3.1. OPERATION OF THE AWSC

The implementation of the AWSC is summarised as follows:

**Step 1:** An exporter is required to apply for CE status in accordance
with AMS's laws and regulations. Once the application is accepted, the
exporter is authorised as a CE.

**Step 2:** AMS will then upload CEs' information onto the AWSC CE
database. [3]

**Step 3:** The CE makes out ODs for its goods provided such goods
meet ROO criteria under the ATIGA. [4]

**Step 4:** The CE sends the OD to the importer.

**Step 5:** The importer presents the OD to the customs authority of the
importing AMS to avail the ATIGA preferential tariff treatment.

**Step 6:** The customs authority of the importing AMS verifies the
authenticity of the OD submitted by the importer, through the CE
Database, and the validity of the declaration made by the exporter.

**Step 7:** The customs authority grants ATIGA preferential tariff treatment
to the goods supported by the ODs if such ODs matches with the
information in the AWSC CE database and there are no other concerns
raised with the declaration.

3 The CE Database is for the purpose of the Customs and Competent authorities' use to verify the CEs and not open
to the public.

4 For more specific information about how to make out ODs, please refer to Rule 12B of the ATIGA OCP.

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

The below diagram highlights the implementation of the AWSC:

**Figure 4.** Summary of AWSC Implementation

3.2. VERIFICATION PROCESS

The importing AMS may request the Competent Authority of the
exporting AMS to conduct a retroactive check at random and/or when
it has reasonable doubt as to the authenticity of the document or as
to the accuracy of the information regarding the origin of the goods in
question or of certain parts thereof.

Once requested, the Competent Authority of the exporting AMS shall
conduct a retroactive check on a producer/exporter's cost statement,
within a six (6) month timeframe from the date of exportation.

**16**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

While awaiting verification result, the customs authority of the importing
AMS may suspend the grant of preferential treatment. However, unless
the goods are held due to any import prohibition/ restriction or any
suspicion of fraud, they may be released to the importer subject to
domestic laws and regulations and any administrative measures
deemed necessary.

In exceptional cases if the importing AMS is not satisfied with the
results of the retroactive check, it may request for verification visits to
the exporting AMS.

Prior to conducting verification visit, an importing AMS shall deliver a
written notification of its intention to the exporter/producer, importer,
and relevant authorities in whose territory the visit is to take place. The
verification visit is only conducted once the importing AMS has received
a written consent from the exporter/producer whose premises are to be
visited. Failure to respond to the notification from the importing AMS
may result in a suspension of the preferential tariff treatment.

After the verification visit, the importing AMS must provide all related
parties with a written confirmation of whether the subject goods qualify
as originating goods. While awaiting the results of the verification visit,
the suspension of preferential treatment may be applied.

More information on the AWSC verification process is provided in Rules
18 and 19 of the ATIGA OCP.

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

3.3. DIFFERENCES AMONG OD, ATIGA E-FORM D, AND PAPERBASED FORM D

Both ATIGA e-Form D and paper-based Form D are still in use once
the AWSC is implemented. These types of proof of origin will mostly be
used by exporters who are not able to obtain the CE status and may
also be used by CEs if they prefer. [5]

Key differences among ODs under AWSC, ATIGA e-Form D and paperbased Form D are summarised as follows:

CERTIFIED EXPORTERS

**1. Why the risk of abusing the OD only focuses on the CE whose**
**CE status may be withdrawn?**

The AWSC is a self-certification scheme for authorised exporters.
Therefore, Rule 12D (Withdrawal of the Authorisation) only applies to
the CEs.

**2. What will happen to an importer if he/she is caught abusing the**
**OD provided by the CE?**

Penalties applied to importers' abuse on OD would follow domestic
laws and regulations of each AMS. Please contact the competent

authorities of each AMS for more details.

**19**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

**3. Is it required that the importer in the importing country must have**
**a CE status to be entitled to the benefits of the AWSC Scheme?**

No, it is not required for the importer in the importing country to have
a CE status.

**4. Is it possible for a consortium to apply for a CE status?**

Yes. Provided that the consortium meets the criteria in Rule 12A of
the OCP for the ROO in the ATIGA and domestic criteria set by the
exporting AMS.

COMPETENT AUTHORITIES

**5. With regards to the obligation of the CE, how frequently will the**
**audits of compliance be conducted?**

The frequency of compliance audit depends on each AMS' domestic
laws and regulations.

**6. Before a CE issues an OD, does he/she need to submit/register**
**their products with the competent authority first?**

Yes, a CE must register the products to the competent authorities first.
A CE shall make out ODs only for goods for which the CE has been
authorised to make and for which the CE has all appropriate documents
proving the originating status of the goods concerned. Please refer to
the paragraph 4(b) of Rule 12A of the ATIGA OCP:

**20**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

_4. A CE shall have the following obligations:_

_(b) make out ODs only for goods for which the CE has_
_been authorised to make out an OD and for which the CE_
_has all appropriate documents proving the originating_
_status of the goods concerned at the time of making out_
_the declaration._
# _"_

ORIGIN DECLARATION

**7. What are the implications/penalties for issuing incorrect ODs**
**both accidentally and purposefully?**

As provided for in Rule 12D of the OCP, the issuance of incorrect ODs
may result in the withdrawal of the authorisation. It shall do so where
the CE no longer offers the guarantees referred to in Rule 12A (1), no
longer fulfils the conditions referred to in Rule 12A (2) or otherwise
abuses the authorisation. The additional penalties are provided in the
AMS' laws and regulations. Please contact the competent authority of
each AMS for more details.

**8. In case there is a dispute relating to OD, will the claim for**
**the ATIGA preferential tariff based on that OD be automatically**
**rejected, or will a verification process be the first step?**

Please refer to paragraphs 3 and 4 of Rules 13 of the ATIGA OCP as
follows:

**21**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

# _"_

_3. In cases when an OD is rejected by the customs_
_authority of the importing Member State, the subject_
_OD shall be returned to the Competent Authority within_
_a reasonable period not exceeding sixty (60) days._
_The Competent Authority shall be duly notified of the_
_grounds for the denial of tariff preference._

_4. In the case where the Proof of Origin is not accepted,_
_as stated in the preceding paragraphs 2 and 3 of this_
_Rule, the importing Member State should accept and_
_consider the clarifications made by the Issuing Authority_
_or Competent Authority and assess again whether or_
_not the Proof of Origin can be accepted for the granting_
_of the preferential treatment. The clarifications should_
_be detailed and exhaustive in addressing the grounds_
_of denial of preference raised by the importing Member_
_State._
# _"_

For further details, please refer to Rules 16, 18, 19 of the ATIGA OCP.

**9. Will an OD in the form of a commercial invoice be accepted in**
**all AMS?**

Yes, the CE shall present an OD which can be made on the commercial
invoice or other commercial documents (billing statement, delivery
order or packing list), provided that all information required under
Attachment 1 (List of Data requirements) of the ATIGA OCP is available
in the document. Other commercial documents may only be used if the
commercial invoice is not available at the time of export.

**22**

**10. In case there is no commercial invoice, is it possible for the**
**CE to issue an OD on other commercial documents? Otherwise,**
**should the CE issue an OD on the packing list instead?**

The OD under the AWSC Scheme can be made out on the commercial
invoice or other commercial documents (billing statement, delivery
order or packing list), provided that all information required under
Attachment 1 (List of Data requirements) of the ATIGA OCP are available
in the document. Other commercial documents may only be used if the
commercial invoice is not available at the time of export.

**23**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

**12. Will a CE be allowed to issue a back-to-back OD under the**
**AWSC Scheme?**

Yes, a CE may make out a Back-to-back OD as long as it follows
paragraph 2 of Rule 11 (Back-to-Back Proof of Origin) of the ATIGA
OCP.

**13. Do the authorities in the importing countries accept the**
**photocopy or the scanned copy of OD?**

The acceptance of scanned copy of OD depends on each AMS'
domestic laws and regulations. Singapore could accept the photocopy
or scanned copy of OD. For other AMS, traders are advised to contact
the Customs authorities for more information.

**14. What will happen to the OD under the SCPP1 that arrives in the**
**destination country after the AWSC Scheme enters into force on or**
**after 20 September 2020?**

The SCPP1 has been terminated since 20 September 2020. The
exporters are able to make out an OD under the SCPP1 until 19
September 2020. The ODs under SCPP1 are valid for one (1) year from
the date of issuance. Thus, an OD made out on 19 September 2020 is
still valid until 18 September 2021.

As for SCPP2, exporters are also able to make out an invoice declaration
under SCPP2 until 19 September 2020. Similar with SCPP1, invoice
declarations under SCPP2 are valid for 1 year from the date of issuance.

**24**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

**15. Will the OD under the AWSC Scheme replace Form D or e-Form**
**D?**

No. CEs may choose to use AWSC OD, paper-based Form D, or e-Form
D or even all of them.

**16. Do the CEs have the right to choose whether to use the e-Form**
**D, the paper-based Form D, or the OD under the AWSC?**

Yes, the CEs are allowed to choose whether to use the e-Form D, the
paper-based Form D, or the OD under the AWSC Scheme. However,
Malaysia no longer issues paper-based Form D so as to encourage the
utilization of ATIGA e-Form D. Please contact the competent authority
of each AMS for more details.

**17. Is a CE allowed to choose between the 6-digit HS Codes,**
**or 8-digit AHTN Codes, or 10-digit National Tariff Nomenclature**
**Codes?**

It is allowed to choose either the 6-digit HS Codes or 8-digit AHTN
Codes provided that those codes on the OD are consistent with what
registered under the AWSC CE Database system.

**18. Will a CE be allowed to issue a Third Country Invoicing OD**
**under the AWSC Scheme? If yes, how should the CE make the OD**
**since the invoice is not issued by the CE?**

Yes, a CE may make out an Origin Declaration on other commercial
documents (eg. Billing statement, Delivery Order, Packing List) if the
shipment is a case of Third Country Invoicing in accordance to Rule 23
(Third Country Invoicing) of the ATIGA OCP.

**25**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

AUTHORISED SIGNATORIES

**19. Is it possible for a freight forwarder or customs agent to**
**represent the CE as an authorised signatory?**

Freight forwarders or customs agents, if nominated by the CEs, are
able to represent the CE as authorised signatories, subject to each
AMS' domestic laws and regulations.

GENERAL QUESTIONS

**20. When did the AWSC Scheme enter into force in the ASEAN**
**region?**

20 September 2020.

**21. Will there be national level orientation workshops to be**
**provided?**

Yes, most AMS organised AWSC national workshops. Please contact
the competent authorities in your country or the focal points of the SCAROO for more information.

**22. Is there any agreed turnaround time from the government**
**agencies for every stage of the self-certification process?**

A timeline has been provided in the ATIGA OCP which includes:

- An OD shall be valid 12 months from the date of its issuance;

- A rejected OD should be returned to Competent Authority of the
exporting party no later than 60 days;

**26**

submitted to the customs authority of the importing Member
State within that period.

(b) Where the Proof of Origin is submitted to the customs authority
of the importing Member State after the expiration of the time
limit for its submission, such Proof of Origin is still to be accepted
when failure to observe the time limit results from force majeure

(c) In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authority
in the importing Member State may accept such Proof of
Origin provided that the goods have been imported before the
expiration of the time limit.

Member State and not exceeding US$ 200.00 FOB, the production of a
Proof of Origin shall be waived and the use of simplified declaration by
the exporter that the goods in question have originated in the exporting
Member State will be accepted. Goods sent through the post not
exceeding US$ 200.00 FOB shall also be similarly treated.

**49**

ASEAN-wide Self-Certification Guidebook

**RULE 16**

TREATMENT OF MINOR DISCREPANCIES

discovery of minor discrepancies, such as typographical errors,
between the statements made in the Proof of Origin and those
made in the documents submitted to the customs authority of
the importing Member State for the purpose of carrying out the
formalities for importing the goods shall not ipso facto invalidate
the document if it is duly established that the document does in
fact correspond to the goods submitted.

2. In cases where the exporting Member State and importing
Member State have different tariff classifications for a good
subject to preferential tariffs, the goods shall be released at
the MFN rates or at the higher preferential rate, subject to the
compliance of the applicable ROO, and no penalty or other
charges shall be imposed in accordance with relevant laws
and regulations of the importing Member State. Once the
classification differences have been resolved, the correct rate
shall be applied and any overpaid duty shall be refunded if
applicable, in accordance with relevant laws and regulations of
the importing Member State, as soon as the issues have been
resolved.

3. For multiple items declared under the same Proof of Origin, a
problem encountered with one of the items listed shall not affect
or delay the granting of preferential treatment and customs
clearance of the remaining items listed in the Proof of Origin.
