Circular No: 06/2024
26 Jul 2024

Traders and Declaring Agents

Dear Sir/Madam,

**IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS**
**(ASEAN)** **AUTHORISED** **ECONOMIC** **OPERATOR** **(AEO)** **MUTUAL**
**RECOGNITION ARRANGEMENT (MRA)**

The ASEAN AEO MRA (AAMRA) will be operational with effect from 1 Aug
2024 for three ready ASEAN member states (AMS) -- Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia [1]
and Singapore. Under this MRA, companies certified under Singapore Customs'
Secure Trade Partnership-Plus (STP-Plus) programme can benefit from facilitated
clearance for their goods exported to Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia. Likewise,
companies accredited under these two AMS' AEO programmes will enjoy similar
facilitation on their goods exported to Singapore. The remaining seven AMS
(Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam)
are targeting to implement the AAMRA at a later date.

**STP-Plus Companies Exporting to or Importing from the Two AMS**

2 For STP-Plus companies who are exporting to or importing from Brunei
Darussalam and Malaysia, please provide your STP code to your business partner(s)
in these countries to be declared in the export or import declaration submitted to
respective countries' Customs administration. Your business partner(s) in these
countries need not be AEO accredited.

**Singapore Companies Exporting to or Importing from ASEAN AEO Companies**

3 For Singapore companies who are exporting to or importing from ASEAN AEO
companies, please obtain your business partner's AEO code and declare it in your
TradeNet export or import permit declaration in the following manner:

|Declaration Field|Information to be declared|
|---|---|
|Customs Procedure Code (CPC)|AEO|
|Processing Code 1 (PC1)|Either BN or MY|
|Processing Code 2 (PC2)|AEO number|

1 Malaysia has an existing AEO MRA with Singapore. No change to permit declaration procedures. Refer to
[Circular 05/2024.](https://www.customs.gov.sg/files/news-and-media/Circular_05_2024.pdf)

companies exporting to or importing from ASEAN AEO companies may declare both
their AEO code and their business partner's AEO code in their TradeNet permit
declarations.

**Domestic Facilitated Clearance for STP-Plus and STP Importers and Exporters**
