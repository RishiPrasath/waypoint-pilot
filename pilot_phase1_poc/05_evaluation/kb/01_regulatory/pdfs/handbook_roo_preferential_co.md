Rules of Origin (ROOs) help to determine the "nationality" of a good. It establishes the goods'
eligibility for preferential treatment under a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Goods that satisfy
the ROOs under an FTA may be considered as an originating good and be allowed to pay lower
or no import tariffs when imported into a Party under the FTA.

ROOs vary from FTAs to FTAs. As such, a good which qualify for a FTA may not be able to
qualify as an originating good in other FTAs.

FTAs improve the

Whoa...I should

start to use the
FTAs soon too!

#### **1. Introduction**

##### **1.1. What is an originating good?**

A good is considered to be originating if it meets the origin criteria(on) stipulated in the Rules
of Origin (ROO) chapter of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). More details on the origin criteria
are provided in Section 2 of this handbook.

An originating good in an exporting Party can be broadly classified under 2 categories --

a) A good that is Wholly Obtained (WO) i.e. wholly grown or produced; or
b) A good that is manufactured using non-originating materials.

##### **1.2. What are non-originating materials?**

Non-originating materials are materials/components --

a) Imported from a country that is not a Party to the Free Trade Agreement (FTA);
b) Produced in one of the Parties to the FTA but are not able to meet the Rules of Origin

under the FTA; or
c) Whose origin cannot be determined.

Page | 6

#### **2. Origin Criteria**

A **good is considered to be Wholly Obtained (WO)** if it occurs naturally; is a plant that is
grown and harvested; or is an animal that is born and raised; or it is a waste that is derived from
production in the country of export. It also includes goods which are produced entirely from
originating materials. One example of a WO good would be plastic bottles that are used and
collected in Singapore.

**Goods that are produced using non-originating materials** will have to undergo substantial
transformation in a country for the good to be qualified as originating. The methods used to
measure the transformation change are:

a) Change in Tariff Classification (CTC);
b) Regional Value Content (RVC);
c) Process rule

These 3 methods can be used in combination or standalone, depending on the origin criteria(on)
for the good in a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The origin of these goods would be dependent
on the country where the last substantial transformation is performed.

Generally, most of the goods exported from Singapore are categorised under this category. The
goods will qualify via one or a combination of the methods listed above, depending on the
FTAs.

|Wholly Substantial<br>Obtained Transformation|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Wholly<br>Obtained<br>Substantial<br>Transformation|||

Page | 7

##### **2.1. Change in Tariff Classification (CTC) Method**

The CTC method is applicable only to non-originating materials. To qualify under this origin
criterion, non-originating materials that are used in the production of the good must not have
the same HS classification (e.g. Chapter level, Heading level or Sub Heading Level) as the final
good. Depending on the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) requirements, the good would have to
undergo either a change in Chapter, Heading or Sub Heading level in order to qualify for
preferential treatment under the FTA.

Therefore, to use this method, manufacturers and/or exporters are required to know the HS
classification of the final good and the non-originating raw materials.

|CTC<br>Change in Change in Tariff Change in Sub<br>Chapter (CC) Heading (CTH) Heading (CTSH)<br>(1st 2 Digits) (1st 4 Digits) (1st 6 Digits)|Col2|
|---|---|
|Change in<br>Chapter (CC)<br>(1st 2 Digits)|Change in Sub<br>Heading (CTSH)<br>(1st 6 Digits)|

Page | 8

##### **2.2. Regional Value Content (RVC) Method**

This rule requires that a certain percentage of the good's value originates in a Party to the Free
Trade Agreement (FTA) for the good to be considered as originating. There are generally two
approaches that can be used to calculate the RVC:

a) Build-Up (BU); or
b) Build-Down (BD).

**BU Approach**

Value of locally produced materials + direct labour & overheads + profit
RVC =

FOB Value

**BD Approach**

X 100%

RVC =

FOB Value − Value of non − originating materials

FOB Value

X 100%

The full value of a locally produced material may only be included in the numerator of the
calculation if the material is an originating material.

In the case of certain FTA, the exact local value content in a locally produced material which
does not qualify as an originating material may also be taken to count towards the numerator
of the calculation. However, the producer of the material must hold a valid Manufacturer
Registration with Singapore Customs and the material must have undergone processes beyond
the list of minimal operations and processes listed in the FTA. For more details, please contact
Singapore Customs.

##### **2.3. Process Rule Method**

This is usually applicable for chemical goods where the goods will be considered as originating
if it is produced through a specific chemical process that occurred in a Party to the Free Trade
Agreement.

Page | 10

#### **3. Harmonised System (HS) of Tariff Classification**

HS comprises about 5,000 commodity groups; each commodity is harmonised internationally
at the six-digit level of the HS code. They are arranged in a legal and logical structure and
supported by well-defined rules to achieve uniform classification. You will need to understand
how HS is structured before you can apply them in Rules of Origin (ROOs) as the origin
criteria(on) of a good in the Product Specific Rule (PSR) Annex are arranged according to the
HS classification numbers.

Below illustrates how Cranberry Juice is structured in the HS:

|Example D|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Chapter 20**<br>**Chapter Level**<br>**(1sttwo-digit number)**|Preparations of vegetables, fruit, nuts or other parts of<br>plants|
|**Heading 20.09**<br>**Heading Level**<br>**(1stfour-digit number)**|Fruit Juices (including grape must) vegetable juices,<br>unfermented and not containing added spirit, whether<br>or not containing added sugar or other sweetening<br>matter|
|**Subheading 2009.81**<br>**Sub Heading Level**<br>**(1stsix-digit number,**<br>**international HS code)**|Cranberry juice|
|**Tariff Classification 2009.81.10**|For infant use|

For more information on HS classification of goods, you are encouraged to refer to the
[Singapore Customs website.](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/harmonized-system-hs-classification-of-goods)

Page | 11

#### **4. Change in Tariff Classification (CTC)/Regional Value** **Content (RVC) Flexibility**

Manufacturers and exporters may still be given another chance to qualify their goods as
originating if their goods could not meet the origin criterion (CTC/RVC), provided it is
specified for in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA).

##### **4.1. De Minimis**

The de minimis rule only applies to Change in Tariff Classification (CTC). Specifically, it
applies to non-originating materials that do not meet the CTC requirement.

Goods that do not satisfy the CTC requirement can still be considered as an originating good
provided those non-originating materials that did not undergo the required CTC satisfy the de
minimis rule. The de minimis rule varies among the different FTAs. For example, the de
minimis rule in ATIGA allows for a 10% FOB tolerance level of non-originating materials that
do not meet the CTC requirement for all goods.

Page | 12

##### **4.2. Accumulation**

The accumulation concept applies to both Change in Tariff Classification (CTC) and Regional
Value Content (RVC). With accumulation, applicant is encouraged to procure originating raw
materials from within the Party(ies) of the same Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since these
materials will be treated as though they are locally produced.

For example, under the accumulation provision of the ASEAN Trade In Goods Agreement
(ATIGA), a producer in Singapore is able to treat imported materials that are of Malaysia origin
as though they are of Singapore origin when determining whether the good meets the Rules of
Origin (ROOs) requirements to be considered as an originating good. To use this provision, the
producer would have to prove that the imported materials from Malaysia are originating
materials under ATIGA. She would have to obtain the Preferential Certificate of Origin (CO)
under ATIGA (i.e. Form D) to demonstrate that they are originating materials under ATIGA.

Example F and G illustrate how accumulation can be applied to the RVC and CTC methods
respectively.

Page | 14

#### **5. Tariff Differentials**

Tariff Differentials is a newer concept in FTAs, where the importing Party imposes different
tariff rates on the same good from different countries who are Parties to the same FTA. This
may potentially impact the Country of Origin of your goods.

For example, under the RCEP, seven RCEP Parties impose Tariff Differentials -- Indonesia,
Philippines, Thailand, Viet Nam, China, Japan and South Korea. If an applicant wishes to
export goods under the RCEP, the applicant would need to check if their goods are subject to
Tariff Differentials, and consider whether use of other FTAs may be more beneficial.

[For more information on Tariff Differentials, you may refer to MTI's RCEP Booklet.](https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Microsites/RCEP/RCEP-booklet.pdf)

Page | 15

#### **6. Overview on Origin Determination**

*Alternative rule generally refers to the general rule in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). For
the list of general rules on Singapore's existing FTAs, please refer to ANNEX A.

Page | 16

#### **7. Other Aspects to Meeting ROOs Requirements**

##### **7.1. Minimal Operations and Processes**

Some processes are recognised as simple/minimal and cannot be counted towards meeting the
Rules of Origin (ROOs) regardless of the origin criteria(on) of the Free Trade Agreement
(FTA). Even if these processes are undertaken as a combination with each other, it does not
confer origin to a good. Examples of such processes are:

a) Ensuring preservation of goods in good condition for the purposes of transport or

storage;
b) Facilitating shipment or transportation;
c) Packaging or presenting goods for sale; and
d) Washing, cleaning, removal of dust.

Applicants are advised to refer to the Minimal Operations and Processes list indicated in the
specific FTA for more information.

##### **7.2. Direct Consignment**

To retain the originating status of the good in the exporting Party, it is required for the good to
be directly transported to the importing Party. This is to ensure that the good is not manipulated
during the transportation and retained its originating status so that it is still eligible for
preferential treatment.

If the originating good is transited through a country which is not a Party of the same Free
Trade Agreement (FTA), the good may still be able to retain its originating status provided this
is justified as a transport requirement and that the goods have not entered into the commerce
of the transit country and have not undergone any operation other than loading and unloading
there. For some FTAs, the importing authority would also require documentation (e.g.
Certificate of Non-Manipulation or through Bill of Lading issued in the exporting Party) to
prove that the goods are not manipulated or further processed while transiting before the
granting of preferential treatment.

Page | 17

The Operational Certification Procedures (OCP) basically covers the procedures on the
issuance and verification of Certificates of Origin (COs) and other related administrative
matters that shall be observed by each Party of the FTA.

Page | 18

#### **8. Third Country Invoicing (TCI)**

TCI refers to the arrangement, where an invoice that accompanies the Preferential Certificate
of Origin (CO) and used for the clearance of goods in the importing Party, is not issued from
the exporting Party but from another country who may not necessarily be a Party to the same
FTA. In some FTAs, TCI is commonly referred to as Third Party Invoicing (TPI). However,
TPI may also refer to the arrangement, where the invoice is not issued by the exporter or
producer of a good, as in the case of RCEP. Applicants are advised to refer to the FTA text on
how TCI/TPI is defined.

**Example I**

An originating good is exported from Thailand to Singapore with a Form D (i.e. Preferential
CO under ATIGA). However, the invoice billed to Singapore is issued from Switzerland (i.e.
any countries except Thailand and Singapore). Singapore can still accept the Form D and grant
preferential access to the good indicated in the Form D even though the invoice is not issued
from Thailand but another country that is not a Party to ATIGA.

Under such circumstances, the applicant of the Preferential CO would have to indicate details
of the invoice issued from a third country in the Preferential CO.

Page | 19

##### **9. Back-to-Back Certificate of Origin**

The back-to-back Preferential Certificate of Origin (CO) is issued by the issuing authorities in
the intermediate Free Trade Agreement (FTA) country for re-exports of goods, based on the
Preferential CO issued by the first exporting Party. The good is allowed to undergo operations
such as bulk breaking and other necessary operations to facilitate the transport without losing
its originating status.

**Example J**

A Thailand origin good is imported into Indonesia with a Form D before it is re-exported to
Singapore. There were no further manufacturing activities performed while the good is in
Indonesia. In order for the Thailand's origin good to still be eligible for preferential tariff
treatment, the exporter in Indonesia would have to apply for a back-to-back Form D with its
issuing authorities.

_**Note**_

This is applicable provided that the countries involved are Member Parties in the FTA. The
exporter in the intermediate Party must also fulfil all the requirements stipulated under the FTA
to be eligible for the back-to-back Preferential CO application. You are encouraged to refer to
[the FTA website for the eligibility criteria for back-to-back Preferential CO application. If the](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/non-financial-assistance/for-singapore-companies/free-trade-agreements/ftas/singapore-ftas)
eligibility criteria are met, exporter may submit their application together with the supporting
[documents via the TradeNet®. The required supporting documents can be found in here.](http://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/exporting-goods/certificates-of-origin)

Page | 20

#### **10. Retrospective/Retroactive Issuance of Preferential Certificate of Origin**
##### **(CO)**

Sometimes, a good is exported without a Preferential CO. The exporter may still apply for a
Preferential CO subsequently after the shipment date provided it is within the validity period
allowed in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Under such circumstances, the
retrospective/retroactive box available in some of the Preferential COs would be ticked,
provided the issuance date of the Preferential CO is more than three days from the departure
date of the goods.

#### **11. Record Keeping Requirements**

Exporters, manufacturers and importers are obligated under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA)
to maintain necessary documentation to demonstrate that the goods are eligible for preferential
tariff treatment over a period of years. This is usually for the purpose of post-verification checks
initiated by Singapore Customs or the FTA partners. The documentation may be kept in
[electronic form. You are advised to refer to the FTA website or Section 13](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/non-financial-assistance/for-singapore-companies/free-trade-agreements/ftas/singapore-ftas) of this Handbook
for specific details on the record keeping requirement of the specific FTA.

After familiarising yourself with the terms and the concepts used in this Handbook, are you
ready to find out on the procedures to utilise the Free Trade Agreement (FTA)? If you are able
to answer all the questions in the 'Checklist' below, you should be equipped with the necessary
knowledge to apply for Preferential CO with Singapore Customs for the good you have
manufactured.

#### **14. Electronic Exchange of Form D via the ASEAN Single** **Window (ASW)**

The ASEAN Single Window (ASW) is an environment that connects and integrates the
National Single Windows (NSWs) of ASEAN Member States (AMS), hereby allowing the
electronic exchange of data between the AMSs. You may apply for e-Form under ATIGA if
you are exporting to:

  - Brunei Darussalam;

  - Cambodia;

  - Indonesia;

  - Lao PDR;

  - Malaysia;

  - Myanmar;

  - Thailand; and

  - Vietnam.

Under the live operation of the ASW, a Form D under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement
(ATIGA) electronically transmitted (e-ATIGA Form D) from Singapore to any of the above
mentioned AMS for an import will also enjoy preferential tariff treatment. No other Certificates
or Origin can currently be transmitted via the ASW.

To transmit an e-ATIGA Form D, the exporter must first be registered with Singapore Customs
in order to access to TradeNet. There is no change to the Form D application procedures in
TradeNet. However, the applicant must access the approved Form D in the TradeNet Backend
thereafter to authorise and trigger the transmission of the e-ATIGA Form D to the importing
country via the ASW.

Companies exporting goods under AIFTA and CECA are to note the additional information required regarding the manner in which country of
origin criteria, including the Regional Value Content (RVC) and product specific criteria, specified in the Rules of Origin (ROO) in the AIFTA
and CECA trade agreement, are satisfied. You may refer to the India Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs, _Circular No. 38/2020_ for more

(b) Application Procedures for Back-to-Back Form RCEP

[Under the RCEP, companies are required to provide a 'Declaration Letter'. RCEP countries](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/certificates-of-origin/how-to-apply-for-b2b)
have requested all RCEP Parties, who serve as intermediate country in the flow of RCEP
originating goods, to do their part to enforce compliance on whether the goods are subjected to
Tariff Differentials (TD).

Singapore Customs hence requires all companies applying for Back-to-Back Form RCEP to
make a declaration if their goods handled are subject to TD of the importing Party and/or are
[found in the Appendix on Tariff Differentials](https://rcepsec.org/legal-text) of the importing Party. The 'Declaration letter'
must be completed and submitted to Singapore Customs during Back-to-Back Form RCEP
application, irrespective of whether the goods are subject to TD in the importing country.
Companies are to refer to Article 3.19 of RCEP's legal text for the eligibility requirements for
Back-to-Back Form RCEP application.
