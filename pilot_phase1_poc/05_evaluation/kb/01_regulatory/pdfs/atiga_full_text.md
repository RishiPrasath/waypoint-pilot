**ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA)**

In pursuing the goal of establishing a single market and
production base with free flow of goods by 2015 for the ASEAN
Economic Community, a more integrated and holistic approach
would be required. This calls for the integration and inclusion
of existing and additional measures relevant to the trade in
goods initiative under one umbrella. To achieve this, the ASEAN
Economic Ministers agreed in August 2007 to enhance the
Common Effective Preferential Tariff for ASEAN Free Trade
Agreement (CEPT-AFTA) into a more comprehensive legal
instrument. This led to the signing of the ASEAN Trade in Goods
Agreement (ATIGA) in February 2009.

**Key Elements of the ATIGA**
(i) ATIGA consolidates and streamlines all the provisions
in the CEPT-AFTA, and formalizes several ministerial
decisions. As a result, the ATIGA has become a single
legal instrument for government officials who implement
and enforce the Agreement, as well as for the private
sectors who are the beneficiaries.
(ii) The ATIGA annex provides the full tariff reduction
schedule of each Member States and spells out the tariff
rates to be applied on each product for each year up to
2015. This makes tariff reduction schedules transparent
and predictable for the business community. A single
legal enactment to effectively implement the stipulated
reduction schedule up to 2015 is also expected.
(iii) The ATIGA comprises elements to ensure the realisation
of free flow of goods within ASEAN, including the
following: tariff liberalisation, removal of non-tariff
barriers, rules of origin, trade facilitation, customs,
standards and conformance, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The ATIGA contains comprehensive
coverage of commitments related to trade in goods and
mechanisms for its implementation as well as institutional
arrangements. This would allow for synergy of actions
being undertaken by the various ASEAN Sectoral Bodies.

1

(iv) With the objectives of eliminating non-tariff barriers, the
provisions of non-tariff measures (NTM) in the ATIGA have
been enhanced further through codification of measures,
as well as establishment of a mechanism to monitor the
committed elimination of non-tariff barriers.
(v) The ATIGA places emphasis on trade facilitation measures
by including the ASEAN Framework on Trade Facilitation.
Subsequently, ASEAN has developed the Trade Facilitation
Work Programme for the period of 2009-2015.

**Entry into Force of the ATIGA**
The ATIGA entered into force on 17 May 2010 with transition
period of 180 days to ensure a smooth transition from the CEPT
scheme into the ATIGA. After the transition period, no CEPT
Form D shall be issued. In other words, only ATIGA Form D shall
be issued.

2. For the purposes of calculating the RVC provided in
paragraph 1 of this Article:

(a) **ASEAN Material Cost** is the CIF value of originating
materials, parts or goods that are acquired or selfproduced by the producer in the production of the
good;

(b) **Value of Non-Originating Materials, Parts or**
**Goods** shall be:

32

(i) The CIF value at the time of importation of the
goods or importation can be proven; or

(ii) The earliest ascertained price paid for the
goods of undetermined origin in the territory
of the Member State where the working or
processing takes place;

(c) **Direct labour cost** shall include wages, remuneration
and other employee benefits associated with the
manufacturing process;

(d) **The calculation of direct overhead cost** shall
include, but is not limited to, real property items
associated with the production process (insurance,
factory rent and leasing, depreciation on buildings,
repair and maintenance, taxes, interests on
mortgage); leasing of and interest payments for plant
and equipment; factory security; insurance (plant,
equipment and materials used in the manufacture
of the goods); utilities (energy, electricity, water and
other utilities directly attributable to the production
of the goods); research, development, design
and engineering; dies, moulds, tooling and the
depreciation, maintenance and repair of plant and
equipment; royalties or licences (in connection
with patented machines or processes used in the
manufacture of the goods or the right to manufacture
the goods); inspection and testing of materials and
the goods; storage and handling in the factory;
disposal of recyclable wastes; and cost elements
in computing the value of raw materials, i.e. port
and clearance charges and import duties paid for
dutiable component; and

(e) **FOB price** means the free-on-board value of the
goods as defined in Article 25. FOB price shall

3. Member States shall determine and adhere to only one (1)
method of calculating the RVC. Member States shall be given the
flexibility to change their calculation method provided that such
change is notified to the AFTA Council at least six (6) months
prior to the adoption of the new method. Any verification to the
ASEAN Value Content calculation by the importing Member
State shall be done on the basis of the method used by the
exporting Member State.

4. In determining the ASEAN Value Content, Member States
shall closely adhere to the guidelines for costing methodologies
set out in Annex 5.

in accordance with the provisions of Article 57.

**Article 30**
**Accumulation**

1. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, goods
originating in a Member State, which are used in another
Member State as materials for finished goods eligible for
preferential tariff treatment, shall be considered to be originating
in the latter Member State where working or processing of the
finished goods has taken place.

34

2. If the RVC of the material is less than forty percent (40%),
the qualifying ASEAN Value Content to be cumulated using the
RVC criterion shall be in direct proportion to the actual domestic
content provided that it is equal to or more than twenty percent
(20%). The Implementing Guidelines are set out in Annex 6.

**Article 31**
**Minimal Operations and Processes**

1. Operations or processes undertaken, by themselves or in
combination with each other for the purposes listed below, are
considered to be minimal and shall not be taken into account
in determining whether a good has been originating in one

**PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES FOR CALCULATING**
**REGIONAL VALUE CONTENT ON THE ATIGA**

**A.** **Principles to Determine Cost for Regional Value**
**Content**

**i.** **Materiality**       - all cost material to the evaluation,
assessment and determination of origin;

**ii.** **Consistency**       - costing allocation method should
be consistent unless justified by commercial
reality;

**iii.** **Reliability**       - costing information must be reliable
and supported by appropriate information;

**iv.** **Relevance**      - costs must be allocated based on
objective and quantifiable data;

**v.** **Accuracy**      - costing methodology should provide
an accurate representation of the cost element in
question;

**vi.** **Application of GAAP of the exporting country**

       - costing information must be prepared in
accordance with the generally accepted
accounting principles and this includes the
avoidance of double-counting of cost items;

**vii.** **Currency**      - updated costing information from
existing accounting and costing records of
companies should be used to calculate origin.

**B.** **Guidelines for Costing Methodologies**

**i.** **Actual Costs**       - basis for actual costs should be
defined by the company. Actual costs should
include all direct and indirect costs incurred in
producing the product;

**ii.** **Projected and Budgeted Costs**       - projected
costs may be used if it is justified. Companies
should provide variance analysis and proof
during the period origin is claimed to indicate
accuracy of projections;

**iii.** **Standards Costs**       - the basis for standards costs
should be indicated. Companies should provide
evidence that the costs are used for accounting
purposes;

**iv.** **Average/Moving Average Costs --** average
costs may be used if justified; the basis for
calculating average costs, including time period,
etc. should be highlighted. Companies should
provide variance analysis and proof during the
period origin is claimed to indicate accuracy of
average costs;

**v.** **Fixed Costs --** fixed costs should be apportioned
according to sound cost accounting principles.
They should be a representative reflection of unit
costs for the company in the particular period in
question. The method for apportionment should
be indicated.
