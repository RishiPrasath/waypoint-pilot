### **1. Application for a Certificate of Origin (CO)**

1.1 The application for a CO with Singapore Customs is to be made via TradeNet [®] .

The application may be submitted by either the exporter, if he has the necessary

declaring agent and declarant registrations with us, or by his appointed declaring agent.

1.2 The application may be submitted as _(i)_ a single declaration with the export

permit application (i.e. permit with CO application), or _(ii)_ a separate declaration (i.e.

as a "pure CO" application) after an approved export permit has been obtained for the

export of the relevant goods.

1.3 For both options, all the items in the declaration must be eligible for the

requested CO. For option _(ii)_, the items in the declaration must be in the approved

export permit.

1.4 Each CO is shipment, consignee and CO scheme-specific.

### **2. Certificate Types**

2.1 Singapore Customs issues COs under the following CO schemes:

  - ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) of the ASEAN Free Trade Area;

  - ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA);

  - ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA);

  - ASEAN-Hong Kong, China Free Trade Agreement (AHKFTA);

  - ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership (AJCEP);

2 Please note that the procedural requirements for claiming preferential tariff treatment under the GSFTA is still not
yet finalized and there is risk that the importer may encounter potential operational issues such as rejection of the
preferential CO when claiming preferential tariff rates with customs authorities in the GCC.

2.3 The information to be provided in the relevant TradeNet® fields of a CO

application may differ, depending on the certificate type. Please refer to Section 7 for

further information.

### **3. Points to Note when Applying for a CO**

**For All CO Applications**

_**Number of Items**_

3.1 For all CO applications under all certificate types, a maximum number of 50

items is allowed in each application.

_**CO Collection Point**_

3.2 An approved CO for non-textile goods may be collected 2 working hours after

its approval at either of the following 2 collection points:

_a) CrimsonLogic Service Bureau (CrimsonLogic)_

7 Keppel Road

#02-01, Tanjong Pagar Complex

Singapore 089053

_b) Singapore Aircargo Agents Association (SAAA)_ _[5]_

Room 107, Ground Floor

SATS Airfreight Terminal 3

Core H, Changi Airfreight Centre

5 Please note that access to SAAA is restricted to personnel carrying an Airport Pass with the relevant access right.
Please also note that SAAA imposes an administrative charge for each CO collected at its office.

Page | 5

3.3 For textile and apparel goods, the approved CO may only be collected at

CrimsonLogic.

3.4 The applicant is required to specify his preferred collection point when making

his TradeNet [®] declaration for the CO application by specifying the relevant code under

the "Application Product Type" field.

|Product Type|Collection Point|Application Product Type|
|---|---|---|
|Non-textile|CrimsonLogic|NH|
|Non-textile|SAAA|NA|
|Textile|CrimsonLogic|TX|

3.5 All approved COs must be collected within 1 month of the approval date, with

the collection accompanied by a Letter of Authorisation issued by the exporter. Please

[refer to Singapore Customs' website here](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/exporting-goods/certificates-of-origin) (" _How to apply for ordinary or preferential_

_Certificate of Origin for locally manufactured goods with Singapore Customs"_ _**>**_ _"Step_

_4: Collect the Certificate of Origin_ ") for the letter format. COs which are uncollected by

the stipulated period will be cancelled without prior notice to the applicants.

_**Additional CO Copies**_

3.6 The applicant may request for up to a maximum of nine (9) additional copies of

a CO by indicating accordingly in his TradeNet [®] declaration. An additional processing

fee applies for each additional copy requested.

3.7 Please specify the number of additional copies required under the "Additional

Copies" field.

3.8 Please note that only the triplicate sheet (and, in the case of AIFTA/ISCECA,

the quadruplicate sheet) of the CO will be provided in each additional copy requested.

_**Deferred Printing**_

3.9 Applicants who submit their CO application as a single TradeNet [®] declaration

with their export permit application can choose to defer the printing of the approved

CO if they expect changes to the amendable fields in the declaration after its approval.

Page | 6

3.10 The applicant may do so by selecting "Deferred Printing for CO" under the

"Customs Procedure Code" field.

3.11 An approved CO which printing has been deferred will only be printed on the

second working day [6] from its date of approval. The printed CO will capture any

approved amendments made to the application via TradeNet [®] during the deferment.

### **4. Amendments**

4.1 Amendments to an approved CO with permit application shall be made

electronically via TradeNet [®], within the export permit's validity period. The amended

CO will be available for collection at the selected collection point 2 working hours after

the approved amendment. The applicant must surrender all issued copies of the

previous CO replaced by the amended CO at the point of collection.

4.2 In the case where online amendment is not feasible (e.g. the permit is a "CA"

or "XO" permit, or the CO was obtained via a "pure CO" application), the exporter shall

cancel the existing CO and make a "pure CO" application with the correct details via

TradeNet [®] . The applicant should specify in the "Remarks" field of the re-application

the reference number of the previous CO and the reason for re-application. The

previous CO shall be returned to Singapore Customs for cancellation within 1 week of

the re-application.

4.3 Please note that Singapore Customs will only endorse manual amendments of

the CO in exceptional situations on a case-by-case basis.

### **5. Cancellations**

5.1 All requests for cancellation of CO and Preferential CO (PCO) issued by

Customs shall be submitted online via FormSG. Do note that only unutilised CO/PCOs

can be cancelled. Upon the submission of the FormSG, the CO/PCOs will

6 Working day refers to any day between Monday and Saturday which is not a public holiday.

Page | 7

automatically be deemed as cancelled unless advised otherwise by Customs within

the next 7 days. The cancelled hardcopy CO is not required to be returned to Customs.

5.2 To submit the CO for cancellation, please fill in the FormSg

(go.gov.sg/cancellationofco).Upon submission of the FormSG, the exporter should

ensure that the Certificate of Origin has been struck off or invalidated via any method

(eg: marked CANCELLED, crossed out, etc).

### **6. Certified True Copies**

6.1 In the event where the CO is lost, stolen or destroyed, the exporter may apply

for a certified true copy of the CO with Singapore Customs. The application is to be

made with the following documents:

a) A written request from the exporter on its letterhead, specifying the reason for

the application. The exporter shall also declare in the letter the certificate

number and confirm that the CO was not returned to Singapore Customs for

cancellation previously.

b) A complete set of the CO form, with details, including the reference number, as

per that on the lost, stolen or destroyed CO _type-written_ . (The blank CO form

may be purchased from CrimsonLogic Service Bureau at Chinatown Point.)

c) Any sheet of the CO form that was not lost, stolen or destroyed.

6.2 A fee will be charged for each set of certified true copy. For more details on the

application procedures, please email customs_roo@customs.gov.sg.

### **7. TradeNet [®] Fields in CO Applications**

7.1 Please refer to the table below for the TradeNet [®] fields specifically related to

CO applications, and the information to be declared in each field. TradeNet [®] fields

which are mandatory for all TradeNet [®] declarations, regardless of whether it is for a

CO (e.g. "Country of Destination"), are not mentioned.

### **8. Other FTAs**

8.1 Other than the CO schemes mentioned in Section 2, Singapore is also a Party

to the following FTAs:

  - Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership

(CPTPP) [9] ;

  - European Free Trade Association (EFTA) [10] -Singapore FTA;

  - European Union (EU) -- Singapore FTA [11] ;

  - New Zealand-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Partnership;

  - Panama-Singapore FTA;

  - Singapore-Australia FTA;

  - Singapore-Costa Rica FTA;

  - Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TSEPA) [12] ;

  - Turkey-Singapore FTA; and

  - United States-Singapore FTA.

8.2 However, Singapore Customs does not issue CO for all goods under the above

FTAs and for non-textile goods under the USSFTA as these FTAs adopt either a self

certification or self-declaration regime, where the certification or declaration of a

good's origin is to be made by a specific party (e.g. manufacturer, exporter, importer)

in a manner prescribed in the relevant FTA. Please refer to the legal text of the relevant

[FTA here](http://www.fta.gov.sg/) for further details.

9 The Parties to the CPTPP are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. However, not all parties have implemented the CPTPP. Please refer to
[the CPTPP on the Enterprise Singapore website at www.fta.gov.sg for more details.](http://www.fta.gov.sg/)

10 The Member States of the EFTA are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

11 As of 1 Jan 2021, EUSFTA will cease to apply to the UK. There are currently 27 countries to the EU. You can
[refer to Annex A of Circular 18/2019 or 19/2019 for the list of the 27 Countries except UK. (www.customs.gov.sg](http://www.customs.gov.sg/) News and Media > Circulars)

12 The Parties to the TSEPA are Brunei, Chile, Singapore and New Zealand.

Page | 17

8.3 While there is no need for the exporter to apply for an authorised CO with

Singapore Customs to enable the importer to enjoy the relevant preferential tariff

treatment under the said FTAs, the exporter or his appointed declaring agent should

indicate "PRI" under the "Preferential Indicator" field in his TradeNet [®] declaration for

the export permit if it is known that the importer intends to claim the preferential tariff

treatment for the goods' importation under the FTA.

Table A.4: Examples of content in "Origin Criterion" and "Origin Criterion Percentage" fields in back-to-back preferential CO applications

_**Disclaimer**_ _:_ Tables A.2, A.3 and A.4 provide an indication of the admissible inputs for each line of the "Origin Criterion" field under
CO schemes for which the field is mandatory. It should not be treated as an exhaustive list of all possible origin criteria combination
under the respective CO scheme.

You are advised to refer to the Rules of Origin and Operational Certificate Procedures of the specific CO scheme for details on the
applicable origin criterion(a) for your product. Additionally, you are also advised to refer to, for CO application for locally-manufactured
goods, the origin criterion(a) specified on the "Verification of Cost Statement" or "Letter of Acknowledgement" letter issued by
Singapore Customs to the manufacturer and, for back-to-back preferential CO application, the origin criterion(a) specified on the
original preferential CO issued by the first exporting Party, for the specific origin criterion(a) to declare in the application.
