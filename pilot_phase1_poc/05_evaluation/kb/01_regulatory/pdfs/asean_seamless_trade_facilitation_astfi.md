##### Foreword

The growing importance of trade facilitation in international trade is manifested by the
various initiatives and agreements undertaken all over the world. One of these significant
milestones was the entry into force of the World Trade Organization -- Trade Facilitation
Agreement (WTO--TFA) in February 2017, which contains commitments from WTO
Members in expediting the movement, release and clearance of goods, transit, including
measures for effective cooperation between customs administration and relevant
authorities on trade facilitation and customs compliance issues, including technical
assistance provisions. Likewise, trade facilitation has been the focus of ASEAN towards
the creation of Southeast and East Asia regional economic integration. It has been a
continuous agenda in all ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprints including the one
up to 2025 with an objective _towards_ _convergence in trade facilitation regimes amongst_
_ASEAN Member States (AMS) and to move closer to the global best practice_ .

The ASEAN Economic Community 2025 Trade Facilitation Strategic Action Plan (SAP)
outlines measurable targets to increase trade flows by facilitating the efficient movement
of goods across borders. Translating the agenda into practical and measurable manner,
the AMS agreed to achieve a short-term target of a 10 percent reduction in trade
transactions cost by 2020 set by the ASEAN Economic Ministers in 2017. In achieving the
target, the Philippines as the ASEAN Chair in 2017, proposed to measure trade facilitation
in ASEAN using an ASEAN-specific set of indicators, which is designed to measure the
extent to which trade is being facilitated in the region. The ASTFI aims to assist AMS in
their efforts to design and implement trade facilitation policies, regulations, and
procedures.

As a result, the ASEAN Trade Facilitation Joint Consultative Committee (ATF--JCC) invited
the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) to develop a set of the
ASEAN-specific indicators, known as the 'ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators
(ASTFI)', to conduct a baseline study using ASTFI, and to analyze indicators and the extent
of trade transaction cost (TTC) in order to gain insights into necessary reforms to achieve
the ten percent reduction targeted by the ministers.

This publication presents the first round of the ASTFI survey results that reflects the state
of trade facilitation in all AMS in 2018 and provides the basis for the evaluation of the
reduction of trade transaction cost by 2020. The second round ASTFI and the calculation
of the TTC is currently being implemented and will be reported to the ASEAN and the
public in the next few years.

This publication, _Towards Seamless Trade Facilitation in ASEAN: Results of the ASEAN_
_Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators (ASTFI) Baseline Study_, is the result of partnership
and collaboration between ERIA, ATF--JCC, the ASEAN Secretariat and the trade-related
government agencies in each of AMS. This project benefitted from the able leadership of
the late Dr. Ponciano Intal Jr., Distinguished Senior Economist and Senior Policy Fellow of
ERIA, who initiated this project. While it is yet to be completed as in providing a full picture
of efforts of the AMS in achieving the objective of AEC Blueprint, we are confident that
the indicators, along with narrative on key achievements and the remaining gaps, are
useful for conversation amongst policymakers and other stakeholders to continuously

iii

move towards the best global practice. The publication is also useful for sharing
knowledge between the member states considering some ASEAN-uniqueness of trade,
facilitation and the reforms of it, can only be learned from within.

ERIA looks forward to extending this fruitful partnership with ASEAN in a regional-wide
collective effort to strengthen Southeast and East Asia economic integration.

##### Executive Summary

ASEAN has made a strong commitment to improving trade facilitation, which is reflected
in all ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprints including the current one (2025). The
measures included in the AEC Blueprint 2025 aim to achieve a convergence in trade
facilitation regimes amongst the member states and move the region as a whole closer to
global best practices. To make this objective concrete, the ASEAN Economic Ministers
(AEM) in 2017 set a target to reduce trade transaction cost (TTC) by 10% by 2020. This
should encourage the region to focus more on the implementation of trade facilitation
measures, addressing operational and cooperation issues moving forward.

To assist the effort towards achieving this target, especially to allow a discussion amongst
the member states on the areas of reform, the ASEAN Trade Facilitation Joint Consultative
Committee (ATF--JCC) requested ERIA to come up with a methodology to measure the
extent of progress on trade facilitation and to identify the gaps in its implementation. In
response to the request, ERIA developed the ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators
(ASTFI). The ASTFI consists of measures on transparency and engagement with the private
sector; the core trade facilitation measures of clearance and release formalities; export
and import formalities and coordination; and measures for transit, transport, and ecommerce facilitation. Partnering with ATF--JCC and the ASEAN Secretariat, ERIA
conducted a baseline survey for the ASTFI during the first half of 2018.

This public version of the report presents the results of the survey and the analysis of the
study, highlighting trade facilitation efforts and best practices in ASEAN, as well as in each
member state as of 2018. A number of key results were revealed by the survey. ASEAN
Member States (AMS) had performed well in terms of the transparency of regulation and
private sector engagement. The information of regulation is available on each country's
trade regulating agency website, although a need for improvement was identified in some
countries where information in the English language was not yet available. Most AMS
already had national trade facilitation committees or equivalents led by government
officials, with the private sector consulted either regularly or as the need arises. Many
regulatory agencies had implemented close engagement with the private sector, for
example by requesting comments on proposed regulations from the public and concerned
stakeholders.

Performance of the AMS in terms of release and clearance formalities had been modest,
primarily due to issues with dwell-time publication, Time Release Study (TRS) publication,
and self-certification as a regional initiative. The slow progress on ASEAN-related
initiatives in this area, such as the ASEAN Single Window (ASW), self-certification, transit
variables, and mutual recognition agreements on authorised economic operators (AEOs)
also contributed to the underperformance of some of the agencies at the time (some of
these initiatives have since been implemented). Moreover, many of the AMS still did not
have an integrated automated risk management system with a national risk management
framework and the implementation of national single windows was in the early stages.

viii

On transit facilitation and transport facilitation, the AMS were somewhere in between
weak to moderate performance. Performance was weak for the simplified procedures for
Authorised Transit Traders (ATTs), and to a lesser extent the transit guarantee mechanism
and computerised system for transit. The failure to secure full implementation of some
major transport and transit agreements (e.g. ASEAN Framework Agreement on
Facilitation of Goods in Transit (AFAFGIT), ASEAN Framework Agreement on the
Facilitation of Inter-State Transport (AFAFIST), and ASEAN Framework Agreement on
Multimodal Transport (AFAMT)) reflected the low policy prioritisation of these ASEAN
initiatives by most AMS, which seems to be due to low commercial traffic.

AMS performed between weak to moderate on e-commerce facilitation, although some
other AMS were already leading in the development of the domestic regulatory regime
for e-commerce. This is probably not surprising as many AMS were still adjusting to the
new phenomenon, with ASEAN still developing a regional framework on e-commerce
spearheaded by the ASEAN Coordinating Committee on Electronic Commerce.

The baseline ASTFI survey revealed that the gap between the newer AMS and older AMS
narrowed substantially over the period 2008--2018 (as shown by external indicators),
providing a robust foundation for deeper integration in the region. Nevertheless, it also
pinpointed areas of improvement in most AMS to progress in trade facilitation. The
following were the major and 'common', or 'shared', recommendations towards seamless
trade facilitation in ASEAN:

  - All the NSW and ASW initiatives should be fully operational and be truly single
windows. AMS should also adopt more extensive use of digital copies towards
a truly paperless process.

  - The National Trade Repositories (NTRs) and ASEAN Trade Repository (ATR) are
the most important trade transparency initiatives of ASEAN. AMS need to
ensure that the NTRs and the ATR provide the most up-to-date information in
a widely accessible format that is easily understood even by small firms and
traders.

  - Ratification and implementation of the ASEAN transport facilitation
agreements and protocols would be a good signal that the AMS are serious
about regional integration, even if the individual benefits are not significant.
Such agreements should be up and running by 2020.

  - Regional efforts on e-commerce were given a significant boost in 2018 due to
the importance ASEAN has given to them. The AEM adopted the ASEAN Digital
Integration Framework which agreed to implement key action points in some
areas, including digital payments, data protection, digital trade and
innovation, fostering entrepreneurship, and broadening the talent base in
ASEAN. Another issue essential to this is the expedited customs (and other
border agencies) clearance for e-commerce transactions within ASEAN.

  - The implementation of regional trade facilitation initiatives, such as selfcertification, should be accelerated. More bilateral MRAs on issues such as
AEOs or ATTs between AMS would strengthen the regional trade facilitation
regime in ASEAN.

ix

- AMS are included in the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership (RCEP) Agreement. There is a need to look more closely at how
trade facilitation in the wider RCEP region could be enhanced, and in the
process facilitate the deepening of production networks in East Asia.

- The country reports give examples of loose ends that could be tied up to
improve the ASTFI scores and, thus, the quality of services provided by the
border agencies. Updating Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) and publishing them
on the NTRs would be an important step forward, but this is a continuing
challenge for most AMS. Another meaning of tying up loose ends would be
ensuring a smooth 'end-to-end' clearance process. Finally, loose ends could
also be identified by implementing the TRS and making the results public.

A number of cases of good practice in leading AMS offered useful examples worth
emulating by other AMS, which was heavily discussed during regular briefings to the
ATF--JCC by ERIA. Such good practices were considered to be the basis of joint learning
amongst the AMS. Notwithstanding the long road ahead, AMS have already been
heading in the right direction. A subsequent ASTFI overview in 2020 and 2021 will
evaluate the progress and the move towards a seamless trade facilitation
environment in ASEAN from the baseline in 2018.

##### Chapter 1 Towards Seamless Trade Facilitation in ASEAN Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study Summary Report [1]

_Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA)_

**Introduction**

As one of the most trade-reliant regions in the world, it is not surprising that trade
facilitation is a key focus of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as
embodied in the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2015 (ASEAN, 2008a) and
the AEC Blueprint 2025 (ASEAN, 2015). Trade facilitation is a major pathway towards the
attainment of the AEC's main goal: the creation of a '...deeply integrated and highly
cohesive ASEAN economy that would support sustained high economic growth and
resilience even in the face of global economic shocks and volatilities' (ASEAN, 2015: 2) _._

Implementation of trade facilitation measures aims '...towards convergence in trade
facilitation regimes amongst ASEAN Member States and to move closer to the global best
practice...' (ASEAN, 2015: 3). In short, the key strategies towards seamless trade
facilitation in ASEAN are to:

- Significantly reduce the divergence and gap in the trade facilitation regimes
amongst ASEAN Member States (AMS); and

- Significantly reduce the gap or distance to the global best practice, or better still,
be at the global best practice, for each AMS.

Narrowing the divergence in trade facilitation regimes implies that the AMS lagging in
trade facilitation need to work harder, improve faster, and perform better than the frontrunning AMS in moving towards best practice trade facilitation.

At present, ASEAN has two short- to medium-term targets and one short-term target with
respect to trade facilitation. The AEC 2025 Trade Facilitation Strategic Action Plan (ATF--
SAP) (ASEAN, n.d.) lists one impact target and one outcome target, both short- to
medium-term, arising from the key strategies towards seamless trade facilitation in
ASEAN. The impact target is the doubling of intra-ASEAN trade from 2017 to 2025, while
the outcome target is the improvement in performance (i.e. rise) of AMS in global rankings
and surveys. A corollary target is the narrowing of the gap amongst AMS in global rankings
and surveys as a reflection of the reduction in the divergence in trade facilitation regimes
in ASEAN. The short-term target is a 10% reduction in trade transaction costs by 2020, set
by the ASEAN Economic Ministers in 2017.

1 This report is based on the 2018 data of the ASTFI baseline study survey.

The setting of specific quantitative targets for trade facilitation in ASEAN is noteworthy
because it follows the successful approach used towards the virtual elimination of intraASEAN tariffs and the substantial (if still incomplete) liberalisation of services under the
ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services. Such specific targets force the region to have
a greater focus on the implementation of trade facilitation measures and on operational
and cooperation issues moving forward. The ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators
(ASTFI) support this shift in focus as the ASTFI is meant to be an effective monitoring tool
for AMS and ASEAN trade facilitation regimes.

**2.** **The ASTFI and Baseline Study Results**

The results of a survey by the Economic Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) in 2011
of firms in each of the 10 AMS point to two trade facilitation measures as the top two
concerns of the ASEAN private sector for implementation by 2015: (i) improve import and
customs administration efficiency and integrity; and (ii) streamline and expedite import
and customs procedures, documents, etc. (Intal, Narjoko, and Simorangkir, 2011: 45--46).

At its core, trade facilitation is the simplification and standardisation of the procedures
and associated information flows required to move goods internationally, with a focus on
efficient and predictable processes, thereby reducing the cost, time, and uncertainty of
international trade. Associated with this is the transparency and predictability of trade
rules, the effective implementation of trade-related rules and regulations, effective and
efficient risk management that reduces risk and balances trade control and trade
facilitation, and the efficient movement of goods and associated services and information
across borders (ADB and UNESCAP, 2009: 5).

There are two international indicators of the trade facilitation regime: (i) the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development Trade Facilitation Indicators (OECD TFI); and
(ii) the United Nations Trade Facilitation and Paperless Trade Implementation (UN TFPT)
surveys. The OECD TFI measure the implementation of the World Trade Organization
Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO TFA), while the UN survey focuses on the paperless
trade and trade facilitation measures for small and medium-sized enterprises, agriculture,
and women, in addition to general trade facilitation and transit facilitation. Drawing on
Sudjana (2018), the two indicators offer contradictory findings for AMS: while the UN TFPT
survey finds an improvement in results, the OECD TFI find a deterioration. The conflicting
results likely stem from the differences in scope and focus as well as the methodology
used.

Neither the OECD TFI nor the UN TFPT survey are sufficient or suitably tailored to address
the concerns and interests of ASEAN in measuring and monitoring the trade facilitation
regime in the region. Partly in response to this, the ASEAN Trade Facilitation Joint
Consultative Committee (ATF--JCC) decided to develop, together with ERIA, ASEANshaped trade facilitation indicators called the ASTFI.

2

**2.1.** **The ASTFI**

The ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM), during the 23rd AEM Retreat in March 2017, set a
target to reduce trade transaction costs by 10% by 2020. To achieve this target, the
Philippines, as the 2017 ASEAN Chair, proposed measuring trade facilitation in ASEAN
using an ASEAN-specific set of indicators. These indicators, designed to measure the
extent to which trade is being facilitated in the region, are primarily built to assist AMS in
their efforts to design and implement policy, regulations, and procedures that render the
import and export of goods more seamless. Towards this end, ERIA, together with the
ATF--JCC, developed the ASTFI. The ASTFI were adopted by the 49th AEM Meeting/31st
ASEAN Free Trade Area Council in September 2017.

The indicators are constructed to take into consideration the customs chapter of the
ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), the ASEAN Trade Facilitation Framework,
Protocol 7 of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit
(AFAFGIT), the Strategic Plan of Customs Development, relevant sections of the AEC 2025
Consolidated Strategic Action Plan, the ATF--SAP, and aspects of the WTO TFA that are not
covered by the ATIGA.

Thus, the ASTFI are very much geared towards ASEAN, based in part on ASEAN
agreements and plans as well as global best practices. Nonetheless, many of the indicators
echo those of the globally oriented indicators carried by organisations such as the OECD,
albeit with a different approach to scoring. The analysis of the ASTFI results will be
supplemented with the results of other globally used indicators and other sources to
obtain a more robust analysis of the trade facilitation regimes in ASEAN.

The ASTFI consist of measures on transparency and engagement with the private sector;
the core trade facilitation measures of clearance and release formalities; export and
import formalities and coordination; and measures for transit, transport, and e-commerce
facilitation. Appendix II provides the list of variables in the ASTFI.

**2.2.** **Baseline Study Results**

ERIA conducted a baseline survey for the ASTFI, with the strong support of the ATF--JCC,
the AMS, and the ASEAN Secretariat during the first half of 2018. The following are the
key results:

_**Transparency and private sector engagement**_

Timely, comprehensive, and accessible (e.g. via internet) publication and dissemination of
trade rules and regulations is one of the top priorities of the private sector on trade
facilitation. For foreign-based traders, lack of timely and transparent information
becomes a non-tariff barrier, imposing additional costs. Lack of such information also
imposes unnecessary costs on small and medium-sized enterprises, even in-country,
thereby hurting their competitiveness (see ADB and UNESCAP (2009: 28--29)). The ATF--
SAP includes the full operationalisation of the ASEAN Trade Repository (ATR), and
implicitly the National Trade Repositories (NTRs) upon which the ATR rests and with which
it needs to be interlinked.

3

Similarly, given that the private sector is the main partner and client in trade facilitation,
private sector engagement in the formulation, monitoring, and evaluation of traderelated rules and regulations, as well as trade-related policies and strategies, is important.

On average, ASEAN governments perform well in terms of the transparency of regulation
and private sector engagement. AMS performed best in these two components amongst
all the components. Note that AMS have high commitment rates in the WTO TFA in these
areas. The high performance of AMS on transparency in the context of trade facilitation
is also evident from the high scores the region obtained from the United Nations Trade
Facilitation (UNTF) report from 2015 to 2019 (United Nations, 2019). During this period,
AMS managed to increase their already excellent score of 94.4% in 2015 to 97.8% in 2019.

While it seems that AMS have performed well in terms of transparency, a possible area of
improvement in terms of transparency of regulation and private sector engagement is to
provide all available information in English and to increase the scope of information
available on each country's trade regulating agency website. As it stands, not all
information is in English; and it does not fulfil the requirements of the ATIGA and/or is
missing or is difficult to access, especially with respect to non-tariff measures (NTMs).
Most AMS performed well in private sector engagement, indicating that AMS have been
assiduous in communicating and facilitating active engagement with the private sector.

Good private sector engagement practices can be found in the region. Malaysia's Special
Task Force to Facilitate Business (PEMUDAH) is a good example of government--private
sector engagement and partnership. Three factors contribute to the effectiveness of
PEMUDAH: (i) active engagement of the private sector at both the working and policy
levels (PEMUDAH is co-chaired by the government's chief bureaucrat and a private sector
leader); (ii) the method of consensus building amongst government agencies and the
private sector; and (iii) the role of the Malaysian Productivity Corporation (MPC), as the
Secretariat of PEMUDAH, in facilitating the consensus process.

Most AMS tend to have national trade facilitation committees or equivalents led by
government officials, with the private sector consulted either regularly or as the need
arises. It would be ideal if the private sector were to participate in national trade
facilitation committees because they can provide significant dynamism to the reform
process, preferably with a technically competent and credible (to both government and
the private sector) institution similar to the MPC that can help provide options, analyses,
and facilitation in the consensus process.

Another good regulatory practice that contributes significantly to the quality and
effectiveness of engagement with the private sector is for ministries and regulatory
agencies to request comments on proposed new regulations or changes to existing
regulations from the public and concerned stakeholders. In Singapore, this is established
practice in the bureaucracy, even without a law mandating it. In Malaysia, a government
circular on the National Policy on the Development and Implementation of Regulations,
2013 mandates it. In Viet Nam, a law mandates it, while it is written into Thailand's
Constitution. Whether set in a circular, law, or even a constitution, what matters

4

ultimately is that consideration is given to public comments and that this becomes an
established practice in the bureaucracy, since the implementation of laws and
administrative rules can be inconsistent if this practice is not institutionalised within the
bureaucracy.

_**Release, clearance, and import--export formalities and coordination**_

Release, clearance, and import--export formalities and coordination are at the core of the
export/import and customs clearance process, and therefore at the heart of a country's
trade facilitation regime. The WTO TFA and the Revised Kyoto Convention put
considerable emphasis on them. The drive towards paperless trade and single windows is
very much the centrepiece of global and regional trade facilitation initiatives. Strategic
objectives 1 and 2 of the ATF--SAP are strongly related to release, clearance, and import--
export formalities and coordination. As such, they deserve higher weight than the rest of
the ASTFI components if an aggregate ASTFI score were to be made for each AMS.

Based on the UNTF report (UNESCAP, 2017), AMS formalities have performed well since
2015, with a steady improvement in the score from 88.9% in 2015 to 91.0% in 2017. In
contrast, according to the ASTFI, the performance of AMS on release and clearance
formalities may seem surprisingly modest, especially for the trade facilitation front
runners of Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, taking note of the results of the secondary
indicators discussed in section IV. A primary reason for the modest performance on the
ASTFI stems from the inclusion of variables in the ASTFI that are not usually included in
other trade facilitation indicators (e.g. the UNTF report), notably dwell time publication,
Time Release Study (TRS) publication, and self-certification as a regional initiative.

In addition, the best practice performance of release, clearance, and import--export
formalities and coordination includes an intra-ASEAN dimension -- i.e. mutual recognition
arrangements (MRAs) with other AMS on trade facilitation measures for Trusted Traders
or Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs), and pre-arrival processing at land borders. In
both cases, most AMS perform poorly. ASEAN related variables (e.g. the ASEAN Single
Window (ASW), self-certification, transit variables, and MRAs on AEOs) performed
underwhelmingly in 2018 partly because the ASEAN initiatives are still mostly in the pilot
stage (self-certification) or because there appears to be little urgency or compelling need
to undertake them at this time (transit variables). The low scores on ASEAN related
variables, including those on transport facilitation, are a constant refrain in the discussion
of the ASTFI results.

One of the most critical elements in the release and clearance formalities is risk
management or the use of risk-based rules and procedures. Indeed, as the Singapore
chapter emphasises, ' _risk management_ ... is central to Singapore Customs' balancing of
_trade control and trade facilitation_ without compromising either'. The words highlighted
in the previous sentence are critical because they show that risk management must be
rigorous, with a constant review of the controls and an assessment of emerging threats,
entailing adjustments to existing controls or new controls that need to be implemented
without hampering trade. They also refer to tight coordination amongst agencies,

5

especially with respect to data and information exchange, so that risks are properly
assessed, thereby informing selectivity and tactical decisions made. For a global supply
chain hub, effective yet not trade-inhibiting risk management is integral to why Singapore
is a global leader in trade facilitation without hurting its reputation as a trusted and secure
global hub.

Amongst the AMS, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand perform best in risk management.
Many of the other AMS still do not have an integrated automated risk management
system with a national risk management framework in which each agency has risk
management criteria and decision rules and risk profiles, and all the criteria and rules are
integrated or interconnected to allow seamless risk management of shipments and
shippers. Given the importance of effective risk management, which allows the balancing
of trade control and trade facilitation, it is worth considering having a regional
cooperation initiative in ASEAN on sharing good practices on risk management for
efficient and effective trade facilitation.

The export/import formalities and coordination component of the ASTFI has the widest
range of scoring amongst the AMS. This is because this component focuses on the drive
towards paperless formalities and the establishment and operationalisation of the
National Single Window (NSW) and the ASW. With respect to NSWs, AMS range from one
of the world's NSW pioneers to AMS where NSWs and their link to the ASW are still under
development. The extent of implementation towards paperless trading also varies
tremendously amongst AMS, from one AMS that is virtually paperless to other AMS where
original copies are still required.

The NSWs and the ASW have been the flagship measure on trade facilitation in ASEAN
since the mid-2000s. The Roadmap for an ASEAN Community, 2009--2015 (ASEAN, 2008b)
targeted the NSWs of the 10 AMS being operational by 2012. However, NSWs are still
under development in three AMS and another AMS is reconfiguring its NSW project. This
reflects the complexity of developing an operational NSW, let alone a well-performing
one.

Singapore's pre-eminence in its NSW is the result of decades of continuous development,
upgrades, and improvement since the turn of the 1990s. At the other end of the spectrum,
Viet Nam and Brunei Darussalam began developing their NSWs in 2014 and 2013,
respectively. The achievement of these two countries in developing their NSWs is
remarkable, given the short period of time it took to operationalise them. However, as
the ASTFI country reports for Brunei Darussalam and Viet Nam highlight, the drive to
complete and perfect the system is not yet finished, e.g. completing the NSW for exports
for Brunei Darussalam and embedding more procedures in the system for Viet Nam.

In the meantime, ASEAN's forerunners in trade facilitation (Singapore, Thailand, and
Malaysia) have been upgrading their systems to a higher level of efficiency and service,
which in the case of Singapore is meant to integrate trade, logistics, and trade finance --
the three areas where the country is globally competitive. Thus, Singapore is transitioning

6

to its Networked Trade Platform, Thailand to its Customs 4.0, and Malaysia is testing its
uCustoms. [2]

Innovations in the new level of trade facilitation in the three countries are worth noting.
These include the adoption of a client relationship manager approach in Singapore and
Thailand, wherein an eligible client or member is given a dedicated customs account
officer to coordinate and help address problems that the client or member may have in
the customs clearance process.

Another innovation, most prominent in Singapore's Trade FIRST, is the differential
categorisation of clients with varying risk profiles in terms of trade facilitation 'privileges',
where the best clients are given the most leeway and support in trade facilitation. This
provides an incentive structure that encourages traders and economic agents to move
towards lower risk profiles. (To some extent, this is a refinement of the common practice
of privileging super green lane or priority (main partner of customs (MITA)) firms in some
AMS.)

Indonesian Customs has been an active player in trade facilitation reforms and NSW
development, despite the twin challenges of being a large archipelagic nation with many
ports (compared with the countries of continental ASEAN) and a country that has yet to
embrace fully economic openness in contrast to countries like Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand, and Viet Nam. Indonesia's NSW allows for live tracking of the flow of shipments
(from their arrival to the port exit to the trader's warehouse) at a number of major ports
in the country, including the flow of permits. Thus, the NSW can provide information on
the dwell time of shipments, which has been given policy prominence by President Joko
Widodo.

Indonesia's NSW does not, however, have information on the timing and flow of permit
processing, from application to approval. In this sense, it is still not a single sign-on or a
real single window. Considering Indonesia's size and expansive bureaucracy (with the
attendant bureaucratic politics), establishing a centralised single sign-on for permits is not
easy, hence the current approach undertaken by Indonesia.

Given the importance of the NSW to trade facilitation, it is clear that greater focus and
investment in the operationalisation and/or perfecting of NSWs deserves top policy
priority from AMS. In addition, the ASW regional initiative relies on the NSWs as its
foundation. After the successful pilot-testing of the exchange of ATIGA Form D, the live
implementation of the electronic exchange of more documents and the involvement of
more AMS would be the next phase of making the ASW a common reality in the region.

_**Transit, transport, and e-commerce facilitation**_

An integrated AEC presupposes efficient connectivity that includes transit and transport
facilitation. These are of particular importance to the Lao People's Democratic Republic
(Lao PDR), as it is the sole landlocked country in ASEAN. Nonetheless, transit and transport

2 'u' stands for 'ubiquitous' because the service is at one's fingertips anywhere, anytime, on any device.

7

facilitation can also be important in other land routes of continental ASEAN, e.g. Bangkok--
Kuala Lumpur--Singapore and Bangkok--Vientiane--Hanoi.

ASEAN has negotiated important agreements for transit and transport facilitation,
including the AFAFGIT, whose Protocol 7 is specifically for transit facilitation; the ASEAN
Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Inter-State Transport (AFAFIST); the ASEAN
Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT); and the ASEAN Framework
Agreement on the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Passengers by Road Vehicles.
The ATF--SAP includes the full operationalisation of the ASEAN Customs Transit System
(ACTS), while Section II C1-iv of the 2025 AEC Blueprint specifies the operationalisation of
the AFAFGIT, AFAFIST, AFAMT, and ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of
Cross-Border Transport of Passengers by Road Vehicles.

The performance of AMS in transit facilitation is low to moderate, with the marked
exception of Indonesia. AMS performance was relatively weak for the simplified
procedures for Authorised Transit Traders (ATTs) variable, and to a lesser extent the
transit guarantee mechanism and computerised system for transit, which for ASEAN is the
ACTS. Nonetheless, the future is positive given that the ACTS has been pilot-tested for
Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand; and phase 2 of the ACTS project will extend it to the
Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) East--West Corridor involving Thailand as well as
Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV).

Similar to the AMS performance in transit facilitation, the performance in the transport
facilitation components of the ASTFI in most of the AMS is low. This may seem surprising
since three of the four variables on transport facilitation are related to ASEAN agreements
that have been negotiated over nearly two decades, starting with the signing of the
AFAFGIT in 1998. The failure to secure full implementation of the four major transport
and transit agreements reflects the low policy prioritisation of these ASEAN initiatives by
most AMS.

A possible major reason for this apparent lack of policy emphasis on the implementation
of the ASEAN agreements is that they may be superfluous. The transport agreements are
mainly geared at continental ASEAN (although Borneo island also has borders), which
already has the GMS Cross-Border Transport Facilitation Agreement (CBTA), signed in
1999 -- covering Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam, plus China.
Bilateral and trilateral road transport agreements have also been signed amongst these
states as a pragmatic approach to the implementation of the GMS CBTA, which has now
been implemented on at least three major GMS borders (Feng, 2014). Given the
implementation of the CBTA, albeit still partial, implementing the ASEAN transport
agreements does not seem to be urgent. In addition, the implementation approach of the
GMS CBTA -- relying on a series of bilateral and trilateral transport agreements -- seems to
suggest that the implementation of the transport agreements, together with the various
protocols, is very challenging.

8

The other possible major reason is that commercial traffic appears to be limited. This also
seems to be a main reason for the low scores in transit facilitation, with the marked
exception of Indonesia. The results of the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO)
survey on the ASEAN Logistics Map for 2008 (JETRO, 2009) indicate that road transport is
costlier but faster than sea transport in ASEAN. In addition, up until 2008, most of the land
routes had limited and/or very unbalanced commercial trade, with the sole exception of
the Bangkok--Kuala Lumpur--Singapore route. Even for this route, much of the volume of
trade was between Thailand and Malaysia and between Malaysia and Singapore, with
little through traffic between Thailand and Singapore. This means that much of the trade
volume amongst the three countries is by sea. For the Lao PDR, transit issues have been
addressed in bilateral agreements with Thailand and Viet Nam. Indonesia has borders
with Timor-Leste and eastern Malaysia, and the border arrangements are likely primarily
to facilitate local cross-border trade.

The experience of the GMS countries provides some good practices in transit and
transport facilitation. For example, the GMS--CBTA Single Stop Inspection mechanism
allows border control authorities from two countries to conduct joint one-stop
inspections at inbound checkpoints. For example, at the Lao Bao--Dansavanh border
crossing between Viet Nam and the Lao PDR, Vietnamese trucks are checked only at the
Dansavanh border crossing and Lao PDR trucks are checked only at the Lao Bao border
crossing. The result has been a drastic drop in the average clearance time for trucks from
90 minutes to 29 minutes. The GMS CBTA also has a 'single window inspection' wherein
different inspections and controls of goods (e.g. customs, phytosanitary/plant protection,
and veterinary) are carried out jointly and simultaneously by the respective competent
authorities involved. Indeed, as agreed by the Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the initial one-stop
inspection conducted by customs will be expanded to all the customs, immigration, and
quarantine border agencies, resulting in an even faster clearance time (see ADB and
Australian Aid (2013)).

The ACTS is very good practice when fully implemented -- it could lead to seamless transit
facilitation in continental ASEAN at least. Its key features are a single electronic goods
declaration from departure to destination; duties and taxes at risk covered by a single
guarantee that is reduced or waived for ATTs; simplified procedure privileges for ATTs;
the application of common risk management techniques; a waiver of the need to transfer
goods to a different truck in each country; and a digital customs system linking all customs
offices in transit routes and linking all traders to customs offices of departure (see ARISE
(2014)).

AMS performance in e-commerce facilitation ranges from weak to moderate, with
Malaysia and Thailand taking the lead in the development of the domestic regulatory
regime for e-commerce. This is probably not surprising as many AMS are still adjusting to
the new phenomenon, with ASEAN still developing a regional framework on e-commerce
spearheaded by the ASEAN Coordinating Committee on Electronic Commerce. In
preparing AMS to face this new economic climate, the ASEAN Coordinating Committee on

9

Electronic Commerce consolidated the ASEAN Work Programme on Electronic Commerce,
2017--2025, which includes a review of the regional legal framework on e-commerce.

The policy issues captured by the three variables of e-commerce facilitation are all
challenging: (i) a legal framework for an interoperable cross-border e-commerce trading
system, (ii) a legal framework for domestic and cross-border e-commerce dispute
settlement, and (iii) a revenue collection framework for cross-border e-commerce trade.
The variables in the e-commerce section of the ASTFI do not include the issues of data
localisation and privacy, which are currently contentious globally.

Amongst the AMS, Malaysia and Thailand are the leading countries in the e-commerce
indicators. For the three indicators mentioned above, regulations are being implemented
on a wider scale in Malaysia and Thailand.

Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Singapore are the second group of countries leading the
AMS in facilitating e-commerce. Viet Nam and the Philippines have applied regulations
that support the implementation of (i) a legal framework for an interoperable crossborder e-commerce trading system, and (ii) a legal framework for domestic and crossborder e-commerce dispute settlement. Viet Nam and the Philippines also have a revenue
collection framework for cross-border e-commerce trade at a developmental stage.

Singapore has implemented (i) a legal framework for an interoperable cross-border ecommerce trading system, and (ii) a revenue collection framework for cross-border ecommerce trade, but has not implemented anything to provide a legal framework for
domestic and cross-border e-commerce dispute settlement. The rest of the AMS still lag
behind in facilitating e-commerce trade, as they do not have a widely applied facilitative
policy for e-commerce trade.

**3.** **Insights on/from the ASTFI Country Reports**

The ASTFI results are snapshots of the efforts of the AMS over the years to improve their
trade facilitation regime -- some AMS over two decades or more and others more recently,
with varying levels of resources available in each country.

**3.1.** **Brunei Darussalam**

The case for efficient trade facilitation in Brunei Darussalam lies in the imperative for the
country to diversify beyond oil and gas. One of the most promising avenues for economic
diversification in Brunei Darussalam is high-value processing trade. This involves a quick
turnaround of imports for exports with Brunei Darussalam's value added -- presumably
primarily via air because of the extremely low liner connectivity [3] of the country -- and the
wage and skill composition of the population.

3 Based on the ASTFI country report, the low liner connectivity performance is manifested through a low
score for logistics infrastructure on the 2016 Logistics Performance Index (LPI) and a low connectivity score
on the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Liner Shipping Connectivity Index
(LSCI). The LSCI assesses maritime connectivity for container shipping, providing comparisons between
countries and over time.

10

Brunei Darussalam has been working on improving trade facilitation. Two key ways
forward have been the introduction of the electronic customs system (e-Customs) in 2010
and the implementation of the Brunei Darussalam NSW since 2013. Since Brunei
Darussalam is aiming at significant transformation and diversification of the economy,
trade facilitation is only one of the important cogs of reform. Hence, Brunei Darussalam
has undertaken a number of major initiatives to improve the business climate. The need
for much better trade facilitation service is because high value processing trade is likely
to be time-sensitive, requiring a very short turnaround time.

**3.2.** **Cambodia**

Cambodia is a success story of trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) driven economic
growth and transformation, with one of the highest average growth rates in the
developing world for more than a decade, resulting in a sharp drop in poverty incidence.
The trade to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has been consistently greater than 100
since 2000 and has been rising secularly from 100 in 2000 to 125 in 2018. As the Cambodia
ASTFI report highlights, trade facilitation is of high policy priority for the country to
maintain its international competitiveness and to prepare it for the eventuality of losing
its preferential access to Western markets as its per capita income rises further.

Cambodia's focused efforts on trade facilitation a little over a decade ago were
remarkable, as described in the ASTFI country report. Cambodia climbed 22 places in the
2012 Logistics Performance Index (LPI). However, its LPI rating has decreased dramatically
in recent years, with its ranking declining sharply from 77 in 2016 to 109 in 2018. Logistics
professionals and executives express significant dissatisfaction regarding Cambodia's
trade facilitation. This means that the successes at the start of the trade facilitation reform
were not sustained. More importantly, the sharp deterioration in recent years seems to
indicate that the country, without an operational NSW, has been increasingly constrained
in the face of the much larger volume and wider range of imports and exports of a fastgrowing trade and FDI driven economy.

**3.3.** **Indonesia**

The increase in rating and the sharp rise in the ranking of Indonesia in the LPI from 63 in
2016 to 46 in 2018 reflect the significant strides that Indonesia has taken in trade
facilitation, especially from 2014 to 2018. Indonesia ranks third amongst the topperforming lower middle-income countries, after Viet Nam and India. The LPI rating and
ranking are based on the perceptions of out-of-country logistics professionals dealing with
Indonesia. At the same time, however, the 2018 LPI report indicates a deterioration in the
perception of in-country logistics professionals on the efficiency of the clearance and
delivery of imports and exports on schedule (see section IV and Figures 1.1 and 1.2).

The apparent disconnect seems to indicate the importance of tightening 'loose ends', as
the Indonesia ASTFI report brings out. Perhaps equally important is the 'end-to-end'
perspective in trade facilitation, which in the case of Indonesia would possibly include the

11

efficiency of moving goods in and out of the Bonded Logistics Centre, [4] as this seems to be
a source of dissatisfaction for the in-country logistics professionals in Indonesia.

**3.4.** **Lao PDR**

The Lao PDR experienced the sharpest improvement in rating and ranking in the customs
LPI amongst AMS, from 2016 (ranked 155) to 2018 (ranked 74). The country belongs to
the top 10 performing lower middle-income countries in 2018, together with Viet Nam,
Indonesia, and the Philippines amongst the AMS. What makes the Lao PDR performance
worth highlighting is that the country started trade reform in earnest only in the mid2000s.

However, despite the remarkable improvement in trade facilitation, the scores of the
ASTFI and the still very high documentary compliance time, especially for exports (as
measured by the high average documentary compliance time on the World Bank's Ease
of Doing Business), indicate that much remains to be done to improve the country's trade
facilitation regime. In 2016, the Lao PDR's average documentary compliance time was 216
hours, significantly above other AMS with a similar level of development (132 hours in
Cambodia and 96 hours in Myanmar) (World Bank, 2018). A top priority is the
operationalisation of the NSW and the component foundations, such as the use of digital
copies and electronic payments (e-payments).

**3.5.** **Myanmar**

Myanmar has achieved significant improvements in economic performance, but there is
still ample room to strengthen its reforms (UNESCAP, 2017).

Myanmar ministries are cooperating closely to implement a series of reforms to enhance
the country's competitiveness and competence in trade facilitation. Since its inclusion in
the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business ranking in 2013, the Customs Department has
carried out many reforms, including the Myanmar Automated Cargo Clearance System
that was introduced in November 2016 and is intended to improve trade facilitation.
Customs has also made advances such as the adoption of the ASEAN Harmonised Tariff
Nomenclature in 2017, the WTO TFA, post-clearance audit, and the Advance Ruling on
Classification and Valuation. On a more strategic level, Myanmar has implemented
reforms of laws and regulations related to trade, such as the Sea Customs Act, 1878; the
Land Customs Act, 1924; and the Tariff Law, 1992 (all amended and modified in 2018).

Despite achieving quite robust growth and development, Myanmar's rating and ranking
in the customs LPI amongst the AMS during 2016--2018 is still low due to lack of personnel
and information technology (IT) infrastructure.

Myanmar experienced the sharpest deterioration in rating and ranking of customs LPI
amongst the AMS during 2016--2018, slipping from 96 in 2016 to a rank of 131 in 2018 --
the lowest in ASEAN. Such a sharp deterioration in the perception of the efficiency of the

documentary needs of goods for import and export.

12

clearance process by customs and other border agencies seems at odds with the many
reforms to improve trade facilitation in the country.

One possible reason is that, as the Myanmar ASTFI report implies, Myanmar's customs
agency is significantly under-resourced, primarily in terms of its IT capability and human
capital (despite the personnel expansion and training programmes), while the agency is
undergoing significant organisational changes.

The other possible reason for the rather perplexing result is that there are 'loose ends' or
'unfinished ends' to the reforms. One key way forward is to complete the reforms while
continuing the institutional strengthening of critical agencies, especially customs, in terms
of both the needed infrastructure and personnel.

**3.6.** **Philippines**

The 2018 LPI reveals an improvement in the Philippines' overall rank from 71 in 2016 to
60 in 2018. However, the improvement is not reflected in the customs LPI component,
where the Philippines' rank deteriorated to 85 in 2018 compared with 78 in 2016 and 47
in 2014.

The reduction in the international customs LPI rank follows the trend of the domestic LPI
score. In 2016, 25% of freight forwarders, as LPI respondents, perceived the clearance and
delivery of the Philippines' imports and exports to be inefficient. In addition, no
respondent (0%) indicated that customs clearance and border agencies were often or
always transparent. Even though the score for both transparency and clearance is low,
the score for solicitation of informal payments improved from 2016 to 2018 -- 0% of
respondents indicated that they had experienced solicitation of informal payments in
2018 compared with 60% in 2016.

In light of the high energy and minimum wage costs in the Philippines relative to most
AMS, it is imperative for the country to have much more seamless trade facilitation --
partly to offset such high energy and wage costs and be competitive in manufacturing for
export. Unfortunately, the ASTFI baseline study results and the secondary indicators of
trade facilitation (see Figures 1.1 -- 1.4) are not comforting: the record is highly mixed.

Nonetheless, the Philippines ASTFI report shows that a number of major recent reforms
provide a strong foundation for a better performing trade facilitation regime. These
include the redesign of the country's NSW, as the old NSW has largely fallen out of use,
with the new NSW based in the Department of Finance. Ultimately, the Philippines will
have to accord the drive towards seamless trade facilitation much more focus,
implementation priority, and energy.

**3.7.** **Viet Nam**

Viet Nam has arguably been the most assiduous of the AMS in its drive to have a wellperforming trade facilitation regime, consistent with its trade and FDI driven economy.
The Viet Nam ASTFI report details many of the reforms and initiatives undertaken. The
improvement in Viet Nam's ranking in the LPI and the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business
Trading across Borders indicator reflects the success of the country's efforts to improve

13

its trade facilitation regime. Viet Nam overtook Malaysia in the customs LPI ranking in
2018 and was the top-performing lower middle-income country in the 2018 LPI. Such a
marked improvement in trade facilitation occurred alongside very robust FDI inflow and
a sharp rise in exports and imports.

However, as the discussion in section IV indicates, there is still significant room for
improvement for Viet Nam in terms of the efficiency and competence of customs and
other border agencies, as well as the issue of informal payments. The Viet Nam ASTFI
study highlights the country's drive to improve, refine, and make the NSW fully
operational -- involving more agencies and more improved features -- so that the
perception of private sector stakeholders can improve significantly in the future.

**3.8.** **Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand**

These three countries are the front runners in trade facilitation in ASEAN, topped by
Singapore, which has been perennially amongst the top seven (and at times, the global
number one) in logistics performance indicators. Thailand and Malaysia were amid the
top five performers amongst upper middle-income countries in logistics performance in
2018.

As the front runners in trade facilitation in ASEAN, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia have
been moving their customs and border management to the next level towards greater
trade facilitation while ensuring trade control and security. Thus, Singapore has Trade
FIRST and is transitioning to its Networked Trade Platform, Thailand has Customs 4.0, and
Malaysia is testing uCustoms. To some extent, this is not surprising because the three
countries (and increasingly, Viet Nam) are the AMS most involved in global and regional
production networks and value chains, where the demands on trade facilitation are
pressing. Moreover, as they are deeply embedded in production networks that are heavily
influenced by technological developments, the three countries need to meet the evolving
needs of industries and businesses.

Despite being front runners, many areas for improvement remain. The ASTFI scores of the
three countries show the areas needing improvement. The country ASTFI reports for
Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand provide country-specific recommendations for
improvement. It is useful to highlight where greater commitment from the three
countries may be needed, for example, for the three to provide signalling leadership, in
words and deeds, to push forward the implementation of the ASEAN agreements as well
as bilateral MRAs that deepen trade facilitation in the region, for example, MRAs on AEOs.

**4.** **Context of the ASTFI Baseline Study Results: The Challenge and Promise of Trade**
**Facilitation in ASEAN**

A trade facilitation regime pertains to the regulations and processes and the associated
institutional arrangements that govern the cross-border movement of goods. Arguably,
there is a positive relationship between the quality of the trade facilitation regime (as
provided by the government and related concerned institutions) and the quality of the

14

trade facilitation services (as felt and perceived by the clients, primarily the private
business sector and industries).

The challenge of trade facilitation in ASEAN can be gleaned from the views of key private
sector stakeholders, e.g. logistics professionals and executives. Indeed, most of the
popularly used trade facilitation indicators rely on the perceptions of key private sector
stakeholders: the LPI, the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Trading Across Borders
indicator, and the Global Enabling Trade Index Pillar 3 on the efficiency and transparency
of border administration. There is also a burden of customs procedures variable in the
World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) _._ The LPI relies significantly
on the perception of logistics professionals (e.g. freight forwarders) while many variables
in the Enabling Trade Index and the customs variable in the GCR rely on the perceptions
of executives.

It is useful to look at a few indicators from the above-mentioned indices to have some
indication of the state of trade facilitation services in ASEAN -- in terms of the efficiency,
transparency, certainty, and integrity of the export, import, and customs processes.
Figures 1.1 and 1.2, from the LPI, present an evaluation of the efficiency of the border
process (customs, other agencies) by logistics professionals based outside the country of
interest (Figure 1.1) and inside the country of interest, i.e. in-country logistics
professionals (Figure 1.2). Figure 1.3 and 1.4 show indicators of the perceptions or
evaluations of executives on the burden of customs procedures (Figure 1.3) and the
incidence of solicitation of informal payments in exports and imports (Figure 1.4) in the
country.

The state of trade facilitation services in ASEAN -- in terms of the efficiency, transparency,
certainty, and integrity of the export, import, and customs processes -- and as viewed by
key private sector stakeholders (e.g. logistics professionals and executives), shows
considerable achievements and significant challenges for AMS and the region. Below are
some of the private sector stakeholders' perceptions of the state of trade facilitation in
ASEAN, based on the LPI and GCR (see Figures 1.1 -- 1.4):

- In-country logistics professionals consider the clearance and delivery of imports
and exports to be often or almost always efficient and on schedule in Thailand,
Singapore, and most recently the Lao PDR and Brunei Darussalam. There have been
significant slippages in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Malaysia, while perceptions have
improved on the Philippines, Viet Nam, and Myanmar.

- In-country logistics professionals view that there is almost always transparency in
trade clearance and on regulatory changes in Malaysia, Thailand (to a lesser extent),
Singapore, and most recently Brunei Darussalam and the Lao PDR. There is a far
less favourable view of transparency in the other AMS, with the Philippines and
Indonesia registering some slippage.

- Foreign-based logistics professionals consider Singapore a global pacesetter in the
efficiency (speed, simplicity, and predictability of the clearance process) of customs
and other border agencies. Malaysia, Thailand, and increasingly Viet Nam follow,

15

but at significantly lower ratings, and with perceptions on Malaysia deteriorating
secularly and perceptions on Viet Nam improving secularly.

Interestingly, the Lao PDR has the lowest rating, which contrasts markedly with the
perception of in-country logistics professionals, who have a far more favourable view. The
LPI report does not provide any explanations for this significant divergence of perceptions.
One possible explanation, though, is that in-country logistics professionals know more,
and are more updated on, the regulatory, institutional, and managerial landscape of the
Lao PDR and could thereby adjust much more smoothly than foreign-based logistics
professionals, especially because the Lao PDR does not yet have an operational NSW.

- Executives find customs and other border procedures in Singapore to be highly
predictable and not burdensome. Malaysia ranks second amongst AMS for this
component. Other AMS where some favourable views were expressed on the
burden of border procedures are Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, the Lao PDR, and
Thailand.

- Executives consider that irregular payments in exports and imports virtually never
occur in Singapore, followed to a large extent by Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia.
The executives are more equivocal for the rest of the AMS.

While these are essentially perceptions, and therefore prone to bias, the results
nonetheless suggest that there is significant room for improvement in trade facilitation
for many AMS. This is consistent with the findings of the ASTFI discussed earlier in the
report.

At the same time, despite the concerns of the business sector -- including the foreign
business sector -- on the trade facilitation regimes in the AMS, virtually all the major
foreign investing communities in ASEAN are bullish on the ASEAN region:

- In the 2017 European Union (EU)--ASEAN business sentiment survey, about threequarters of the respondent EU firms in ASEAN felt that ASEAN has become more
important for the firms' global revenues during 2015--2016 and that ASEAN offers
the best economic opportunities for 2017--2022 (EU--ASEAN Business Council,
2017).

18

- In the JETRO survey of business conditions of Japanese companies in Asia and
Oceania, a greater percentage of Japanese-affiliated companies in ASEAN have
been responding to business challenges with expansion of their operations than the
Japanese affiliates in China from 2012 to 2017 (the latest survey year) (JETRO,
2017).

- In the ASEAN Business Outlook Survey 2018 of AmCham Singapore, four-fifths of
the surveyed executives of United States (US) firms in ASEAN expect their
companies' level of trade and investment in ASEAN to increase in 2018--2023.
Robust economic growth, the rise of the middle and consuming class, and regional
integration are the top three reasons why ASEAN markets will be more important
for the worldwide operations of the US firms (AmCham Singapore, 2018: 15).

- Perhaps the Australian Business in ASEAN Survey 2018 puts it most forcefully and
plainly, as it states that ASEAN, as Asia's new factory -- with strong demand growth,
rising standards of living, and a large infrastructure deficit -- offers huge
opportunities for Australian investors, or for that matter, other foreign and
domestic investors. In addition, nearly nine-tenths of all the Australian firms
surveyed plan to increase their levels of trade and investment in 2018--2023
(Australia--ASEAN Chamber of Commerce, 2018).

Thus, not improving the region's trade facilitation regime and services is an untapped
opportunity for the region.

**5.** **Conclusions and Recommendations: Towards Seamless Trade Facilitation in**
**ASEAN: Elements for Moving Forward into 2020 and Beyond**

The ASTFI results and the discussions above show the remarkable achievements of a
number of AMS in trade facilitation during 2008--2018. What is particularly noteworthy
are the significant strides of the newer AMS, especially Viet Nam but also the Lao PDR and
even Cambodia. Clearly, the gap between these three and the other AMS has decreased
substantially in recent years, providing a robust foundation for deeper integration in the
region.

The case of Myanmar is particular in that the country is in the middle of wide-ranging
reforms and institutional changes as it transitions from a relatively closed and 'planned'
(or perhaps better, 'directed' or 'controlled') economy to a more open and marketoriented one. The reforms and institutional changes have not quite borne fruit yet, based
on the perceptions of logistics professionals, in part because the policy and institutional
changes have combined with under-resourced agencies facing the growing demands and
rising expectations of a fast-growing and changing economy. Nonetheless, there is no
doubt of the strong commitment to improve trade facilitation. Hopefully, as the 'dots'
become better connected, 'loose ends' are tied up, technical infrastructure is developed,
and institutions are strengthened, Myanmar may experience the same large jumps in
performance that the Lao PDR did. In the process, the huge gap in trade facilitation

19

performance within ASEAN would drastically decline, and a more efficient and seamless
trade facilitation regime in the region would be established.

The ASTFI results and the discussion above also point out, however, that there is still
much to be done in many of the AMS to move towards a seamless trade facilitation
environment in the countries individually and in the ASEAN region as a whole. The ASTFI
country reports provide country-specific recommendations. What are highlighted below
are the major and 'common' or 'shared' recommendations towards seamless trade
facilitation in ASEAN:

**5.1.** **NSW, ASW, and Export--Import Formalities**

- The most important and impactful measure for the way forward is to operationalise
the NSW (Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Myanmar); operationalise a reworked and
improved version of it (the Philippines); make it fully operational in terms of the
procedures and the number of agencies embedded in it (e.g. Viet Nam) and for
exports (Brunei Darussalam); make it closer to a truly single window (e.g. Indonesia
and Viet Nam); and finish the upgrading to a higher-performing, integrated,
ubiquitous, and client-focused system, even facilitative of trade logistics integration
(Malaysia's uCustoms, Singapore's Networked Trade Platform, and Thailand's
Customs 4.0). By 2020, all the NSW initiatives should be fully operational and truly
single window, and the upgraded systems of the front runners should be
operational.

- The full operationalisation of the NSWs in all 10 AMS by 2020 is imperative to make
the ASW fully operational by 2020, with the inclusion of additional documents in
the ASW.

- Attendant to the full operationalisation of the NSWs in each AMS, and to make
them perform well, is the more extensive use of digital copies towards a truly
paperless process. While technical constraints can arise from legacy IT systems, the
ATF--JCC should set a target for the percentage of processes that are paperless by
2020.

**5.2.** **NTRs, ATR, and NTMs**

- The NTRs and ATR are the most important trade transparency initiatives of ASEAN.
The country reports show major progress in the NTRs of many AMS. The most
important weakness is the information base on NTMs. ASEAN is addressing this
with the help of the EU--ARISE project and ERIA. Ideally, the NTRs and ATR should
be complete by 2020. Apart from populating the ATR with the appropriate
information linked with the NTRs, the challenge is for AMS to ensure that the NTRs
and the ATR provide the most updated information in a widely accessible format
that is easily understood even by small firms and traders.

20

**5.3.** **ASEAN agreements, ACTS, and stronger cross-border coordination**

- Ratification and implementation of the ASEAN transport facilitation agreements
and protocols would provide a good signal that the AMS are serious about regional
integration, even if the individual benefits are not significant. Such agreements
should be up and running by 2020.

- Land borders between AMS tend to be in the less developed parts of the countries,
except the Johor--Singapore border, and to some extent the Lao PDR as a
landlocked country. Thus, less policy priority is accorded to making their operations
as seamless as possible. Nonetheless, the ACTS has the potential for seamless
transit facilitation -- at least in continental ASEAN. The ACTS should be fully
operational and rolled out to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam by
2020 to show the potential for deeper cross-border trade and economic
relationships between and amongst AMS. In addition, more bilateral and
institutionalized cross-border coordination should take place by 2020.

- Regional efforts on e-commerce were given a significant boost in 2018 in light of
the importance ASEAN is placing on it. The AEM adopted the ASEAN Digital
Integration Framework at the 50th AEM Meeting on 29 August 2018. As indicated
by the Joint Media Statement of the meeting (ASEAN, 2018), implementing key
action points in the six priority areas would facilitate seamless trade and digital
payments and protect data, while supporting digital trade and innovation, fostering
entrepreneurship, and broadening the talent base in ASEAN. Related to this is the
issue of expedited customs (and other border agencies) clearance for e-commerce
transactions within ASEAN.

- The implementation of regional trade facilitation initiatives, such as selfcertification, should be accelerated. On certificates of origin, there may be merit in
the proposal of the EU--ASEAN Business Council (2017) to set up a working group
that includes the private sector to examine the pros and cons, risk management
mechanisms, and documentary requirements if the threshold value for a waiver of
the certificate of origin were increased.

- More bilateral MRAs on issues such as AEOs (e.g. the Singapore--Thailand MRA on
AEOs) or ATTs between AMS would strengthen the regional trade facilitation
regime in ASEAN.

- AMS are included in the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership
(RCEP) Agreement. As the RCEP is fundamentally about building deeper economic
linkages between ASEAN and its six Dialogue Partners, it is clear that trade
facilitation will eventually be an important consideration. Thus, there is a need to
look more closely at how trade facilitation in the wider RCEP region could be
enhanced, and in the process facilitate the deepening of production networks in
East Asia. One possibility is to develop an 'ASEAN Plus Six Seamless Trade
Facilitation Indicators (A6STFI)', which could be a modification and/or expansion of
the current ASTFI.

21

**5.4.** **Tie up 'loose ends'**

- The country reports give examples of loose ends that could be tied up to improve
the ASTFI scores and, thus, the quality of service of the border agencies. For
example, Malaysia could add transit rules and procedures to its customs website so
that both foreign and domestic interested parties would have access to them. The
Philippines could make the quality of the information on the relevant websites
more business-friendly, work with the Philippine Ports Authority to institutionalise
the regular publication of dwell times, and/or expedite its accession to the Istanbul
Convention (adoption of the Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission (ATA)
Carnet). There are many more examples of loose ends in virtually all the country
reports. Updating NTMs and publishing them on the NTRs would be an important
step forward, but this is a continuing challenge for most AMS.

- Another meaning of tying up loose ends would be ensuring a smooth 'end-to-end'
clearance process. For Indonesia, this could mean more than just customs and port
clearance, and could include the efficiency of the in- and out-flow of goods in the
new Bonded Logistics Centre. A significant improvement in customs clearance and
a faster dwell time at the port could be negated by inefficiencies in the Bonded
Logistics Centre, so the private sector may not feel the improvements in the
customs and port clearance.

- Finally, loose ends could also be identified by implementing the TRS and making the
results public. The most important benefit of the TRS is in determining and
prioritising the sources of inefficiency in the export/import and customs clearance
process. This allows for determining ways of tying up loose ends and addressing
bottlenecks. Thus, it was recommended that all the TRSs be conducted in 2018 to
assist the AMS in drawing up action plans to meet the targeted reduction in trade
transaction costs of 10% by 2020.

**5.5.** **Joint learning and regional cooperation**

- A number of cases of good practice in leading AMS offer useful examples worth
emulating by other AMS. Such good practice could be the basis of joint learning
amongst the AMS, perhaps facilitated by the ATF--JCC or the Coordinating
Committee on Customs. Examples of such good practice are:

`o` transparency in rule-making in Malaysia (government circular), Singapore
(ingrained practice), and Thailand (Constitution);

`o` public consultations undertaken on new regulations;

`o` Malaysia's PEMUDAH public--private working groups, with technical support
from the MPC, not just at the high policy level;

`o` Thailand's Customs Alliance under Customs 4.0, which aims to introduce a
customs account officer approach, similar to banks' relationship manager
approach to clients and Singapore's Trade FIRST;

`o` a customs academy (e.g. Malaysia) for continuous training and
professionalisation of the customs bureaucracy; and

22

`o` international and regional benchmarking to propel accelerated and clear-cut
programmes for improvement, e.g. Viet Nam and Malaysia.

- Integrated and automated risk management for permits and customs clearance of
all key trade-related agencies, with all risk parameters and decision rules in one
interconnected platform (e.g. Singapore).

- At the individual AMS level, countries could learn from each other regarding their
attempts to improve the implementation of the various trade facilitation
measures. For example, the Philippine ASTFI country report recommends that the
country apply risk management principles, taking into consideration the nature of
the agencies and products being regulated; study and work with other AMS on
how to integrate the NSW with the NTR; and study and adopt best practices for
AEOs and Trusted Traders to allow the early release of goods, even based on
provisional documentation.

##### Chapter 2 Trade Facilitation in Brunei Darussalam and the Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study [1]

_Dionisius Narjoko and Wee Chian Koh_

**1.** **Overall Trade Facilitation Environment**

Brunei Darussalam's economy is primarily driven by oil and gas, which account for more
than half of its gross domestic product (GDP) and over 90% of exports and government
revenue. This high dependence on non-renewable resources makes Brunei Darussalam
vulnerable to volatile oil and gas prices. Since the oil price collapse in mid-2014, Brunei
Darussalam has been experiencing fiscal pressures and has undergone fiscal
consolidation. The economy contracted for four consecutive years before achieving
modest 1.30% growth in 2017, aided by a recovery in oil prices.

Brunei Darussalam's merchandise exports decreased from $10,566 million in 2013 to
$6,551 million in 2018. The exports are mainly crude petroleum and liquefied natural gas,
which represent 41% and 49% of total merchandise exports in 2018, respectively. The
largest export partners are the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan,
the Republic of Korea, and Australia. Brunei Darussalam's merchandise imports increased
from $3,338 million in 2013 to $4,152 million in 2018. Manufactures dominate Brunei
Darussalam's imports, with machinery and transport equipment making up the top largest
imports, representing 40% of total merchandise imports in 2018, respectively. The main
import partners are China, ASEAN, the United States, and the European Union.

The country's trade performance suggests that trade facilitation will also play a role in the
future to facilitate more non-oil and gas exports.

While Brunei Darussalam is a net exporter of merchandise goods, it is a net importer of
services. The deficit decreased from $2,185 million in 2013 to $1,004 million in 2018 due
to a decline in services imports. In 2016, Brunei Darussalam's services trade exports were
mainly in transport and travel, while imports consisted of transport, travel, construction,
maintenance and repair, telecommunications, computer and information services, and
other business services.

**1.1.** **Policy and Institutional Setting**

_**Trade Facilitation Environment**_

Under Brunei Darussalam's Constitution, His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of
Brunei Darussalam is the head of state and has absolute executive and legislative powers.
His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam is also the head of
government and is served by the Council of Cabinet Ministers, in which His Majesty the

1 This report is based on the 2018 data of the ASTFI baseline study survey.

29

Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam is the Prime Minister, Minister of
Defence, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Legislative
Council advises and debates on policies under consultation or implementation, and
considers and approves annual government budgets. All the cabinet ministers and
legislative members are appointed by His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of
Brunei Darussalam. Brunei Darussalam's legal system is based on common law and Sharia
law.

Brunei Darussalam's initiatives towards diversifying its economy are guided by its LongTerm Development Plan, National Vision 2035. In recent years, Brunei Darussalam has
undergone significant institutional changes and policy reforms to improve the business
environment, facilitate trade, and attract foreign direct investment (FDI). The Ease of
Doing Business Steering Committee, an inter-ministerial and multi-agency institutional
setup, has successfully coordinated and implemented various reforms, which have seen
Brunei Darussalam climbing up the ranks of the World Bank's Doing Business rankings. In
2018, Brunei Darussalam improved from 72nd to 56th position. For the third consecutive
year, Brunei Darussalam is the most improved economy in the world.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in cooperation with other ministries and
agencies, leads the formulation and implementation of Brunei Darussalam's trade policy.
Brunei Darussalam remains committed to free and open trade, and is of the view that
active engagement in free trade agreements (FTAs) with key strategic partners will help
increase market access and investment inflows to help its diversification efforts. Under
the ASEAN framework, Brunei Darussalam has FTAs with Australia and New Zealand,
China, India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Brunei Darussalam also has a bilateral
agreement with Japan (Brunei Darussalam--Japan Economic Partnership Agreement) and
is involved in negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Brunei Darussalam has very low tariffs. The simple average applied most favoured nation
rate has decreased from 3.3% in 2006 to 0.2% in 2018. Meanwhile, the total number of
tariff lines has increased from 10,689 (HS 2012) to 11,206 (HS 2017). However, there
remains a significant difference between the applied most favoured nation tariff and the
bound rate average (25.5% in 2018). While tariff rates in Brunei Darussalam are low, nontariff measures (NTMs) are relatively high, dominated by technical barriers to trade and
sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, contributing to 55.8% and 31.2% of the total of
516 NTMs, respectively. Most of the NTM regulations are for public health safety
considerations on product quality.

The Royal Customs and Excise Department (RCED), under the purview of the Ministry of
Finance, is tasked with facilitating customs procedures. Led by the RCED, Brunei
Darussalam has implemented a National Single Window (NSW) to simplify trade-related
processes and procedures through an integrated electronic platform, including an ecustoms system. This has resulted in an improvement in key indicators of 'Trading across
Borders' in the World Bank's Doing Business report. Likewise, the time taken to import

30

has reduced from 19 days to 7.5 days. While this improvement is remarkable, trade
transaction costs are still much higher than in ASEAN neighbours.

Several regulatory agencies are involved in the trade facilitation process, particularly in
granting licences or permits for controlled imported goods. The major agencies covered
in this report are the Department of Agriculture and Agrifood (DAA) in the Ministry of
Primary Resources and Tourism, the Halal Food Control Division (HFCD) in the Ministry of
Religious Affairs, the Food Safety and Quality Control Division (FSQCD) and the
Department of Pharmaceutical Services (DPS) in the Ministry of Health, and the Authority
for Building Control and Construction Industry (ABCi) at the Ministry of Development
(MOD).

The DAA is tasked with issuing imports permits and transit approvals for agricultural
commodities such as live animals, Halal meat products, vegetables, fruits, eggs, plants,
crops, and soil. It also performs desk audit and import risk analysis prior to importation
approval, manages agricultural quarantine stations, and conducts physical risk-based
inspection at ports of entry.

The HFCD is in charge of granting approvals for the importation of Halal meat products. It
maintains stringent standards for Halal meat imports, such as requiring approved Halal
supervisors and physical inspection of the abattoirs in the exporter's country, for which
the full costs are borne by the importer. The final decision on issuing import permits is
made by the Brunei Islamic Religious Council (MUIB). In addition to the HFCD and the DAA,
importers of Halal meat products also require endorsement from the FSQCD and the
RCED. For non-Halal meat products and processed food products, import permit approval
is only sought from the FSQCD.

The DPS regulates the importation of pharmaceutical products, including medicines,
health supplements, herbal, and cosmetic products. It also conducts risk-based
inspections. The ABCi is tasked with issuing import permits for cement, red clay bricks,
coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and sand, while risk-based inspection and surveillance
audit are conducted by the Public Works Department in the MOD. In January 2017, the
cement import quota was abolished to foster healthy competition and allow cement
prices to be market-determined.

Brunei Darussalam also restricts exports of certain goods, mainly subsidised products, to
ensure adequate domestic supply and price stability. There are no export taxes or levies.

Brunei Darussalam's transport infrastructure consists of a maritime port (Muara Port), an
international airport (Brunei International Airport), and a road network linking the
country to Sabah and Sarawak. There are nine legal entry and exit points. The responsible
transport agencies in the Ministry of Communications engaged in transport facilitation
are the Department of Civil Aviation, Land Transport Department, and Maritime and Port
Authority Brunei Darussalam, in close collaboration with relevant government agencies.

31

Brunei Darussalam's logistics infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, ranking 70th in
the World Bank Logistics Performance Index in 2016. Likewise, Brunei Darussalam has one
of the lowest shipping connectivity scores, as measured by the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Liner Shipping Connectivity Index. This could be
attributed primarily to the size and structure of the Brunei Darussalam economy.

_**Customs Procedures**_

To make trading easier, the RCED introduced an electronic customs system (e-customs) in
2010. The e-customs system allows the trading community to submit applications
electronically to the RCED for processing, including automatic calculations of customs
duties and billing, resulting in a faster turnaround time. In addition, this central database
enables ease of information retrieval and sharing, thereby facilitating monitoring of risks.

Implementation of the e-customs system is the first step towards establishing the Brunei
Darussalam NSW. The Brunei Darussalam NSW was implemented in 2013 and allows for
electronic submission of customs declarations and permit applications for approval from
20 government agencies and online payment of customs duties. Essentially, this eases the
flow of information as well as enhancing transparency and efficiency.

_**Other Trade-Related Reforms**_

Over the past several years, a series of reforms has been implemented to improve the
business environment. Various investment and tax incentives have been introduced, e.g.
encouraging the establishment of industrial and economic enterprises under the
Investment Incentives Order of 2001 and changes to the Income Tax Act (Chapter 35)
enacted in 1949 to gradually reduce the corporate tax rate from 27.5% in 2008 to 18.5%
in 2018. In 2016, Darussalam Enterprise (DARe), the national small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) body, was set up to support local businesses ranging from start-ups to
growth enterprises by providing capacity building programmes, industrial space,
international market access opportunities, and financing. All their programmes and
services can be found online (DARe, n.d.). Other institutional setups include the Brunei
Economic Development Board as the national investment promotion agency, and the FDI
Action and Support Centre to facilitate incoming investment in a fast-track approval
process.

Brunei Darussalam has made amendments to its intellectual property rights regime by
passing various legislation on copyright, patents, trademarks, industrial design, and plant
variety protection, as well as establishing the Brunei Intellectual Property Office in 2013.
Brunei Darussalam has also acceded to and participated in various intellectual property
rights agreements and treaties to comply with international standards.

The Department of Economic Planning and Development in the Prime Minister's Office is
tasked with administering three important pieces of legislation: competition, consumer
protection, and price control. The Competition Order, 2015 was passed to enhance
economic efficiency and consumer welfare by prohibiting anti-competitive agreements,
abuse of dominant power, and anti-competitive mergers. Consumer protection came into

32

force in 2012 under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Order, 2011 to protect
consumers against unfair business practices. The Price Control Act (Chapter 142) enacted
in 1974 regulates the prices of selected essential goods specified in the law, sale activities,
and display of prices.

To support fair trade and competitiveness and to address safety and consumer protection,
the National Standards Centre is tasked with regulating standards and conformance in
accordance with national, regional, and international requirements. As a centralised body,
the National Standards Centre also provides guidance and information on standards,
conformity assessment, product certification, and accreditation administered by other
government agencies -- e.g. food testing by laboratories in the Ministry of Health,
telecommunications equipment licence approval from the Authority for Infocommunications Technology Industry, and Halal permits and certificates from the
Ministry of Religious Affairs.

The Government of Brunei Darussalam takes an active stance on corporatisation, with a
view to improving accountability and governance, thereby enhancing efficiency and
productivity. One of the tasks of Darussalam Assets is to improve the corporate
governance structure of government-linked companies across various industries such as
aviation, telecommunications, power utilities, logistics, agribusiness, food and beverages,
leisure and tourism, medical, education, hospitality, and real estate. In an effort towards
a balanced budget, the government is also engaging the private sector and FDI to work
with the public sector, especially in infrastructure development, through public--private
partnership to address Brunei Darussalam's infrastructure gap and to realise the objective
of several economic and social policies -- including the stimulation of private sector
growth, investment opportunities, and streamlining the public sector workforce.

**2.** **Results of the ASTFI Survey**

A questionnaire survey was conducted during the first half of 2018 with government
agencies on four components: (i) transparency and information on laws, regulations, and
procedures; (ii) communication with and active engagement of the private sector; (iii)
release and clearance formalities; and (iv) import/export formalities and coordination.
The results of the survey are summarised below.

**2.1.** **Transparency and Information on Laws, Regulations, and Procedures**

Brunei Darussalam performs relatively well under this component, despite some
variations amongst the indicators. The information for export and import formalities is
available for the public to access from a single website called 'Trading Across Borders'
(RCED, n.d.). It is important to note, however, that the information available on this
website may not necessarily be available in each of the major agencies, making the
'Trading Across Borders' platform a very unique practice this is not commonly available in
other countries.

33

Brunei Darussalam has established a National Trade Repository, which can be accessed
through its portal (BDNTR, n.d.). The repository includes trade-related information such
as Brunei Darussalam's preferential tariff rates as well as the rules of origin under the
various ASEAN FTAs amongst others.

**2.2.** **Communication with and Active Engagement of the Private Sector**

Brunei Darussalam performs relatively well under this component. Although it does not
have any official mechanism such as a national trade facilitation committee (NTFC), there
exists coordination, on an ad-hoc basis, between ministries for issues pertaining to
international trade. As for the development of micro, small, and medium-sized
enterprises, it is facilitated by the national SME body (DARe). DARe provides a Business
Support Centre for businesses to obtain business advice and information on businessrelated processes; learn about and apply for SME programmes and incentives; and
register business-related issues, feedback, and inquiries. The DARe Business Support
Centre also houses a Business Helpdesk to facilitate business-related issues and enquiries.
This internal coordination mechanism is equivalent to an NTFC.

**2.3.** **Release and Clearance Formalities**

Brunei Darussalam performs moderately well under this component, but with high
variations amongst its indicators. For example, Advance Rulings are restricted to
applicants and are not made publicly available. While the exclusivity of the Advance Ruling
decision is arguably sensible -- as export--import transactions can be unique (transactionspecific) -- this is not yet in accordance with best practices where Advance Ruling decisions
are open to the public. Pre-arrival document processing is available in the two major ports
of Brunei Darussalam (i.e. Muara Port and Brunei International Airport).

The RCED and the DPS adopt risk management commonly applied by customs in other
countries, i.e. assessing import goods by applying inspection randomly or based on some
risk factors, and there is no target rate of inspection. The HFCD also applies a risk
management system, but it is only to fulfil the requirements of Halal food products. As
noted earlier, risk management applied by the HFCD involves physical inspection by HFCD
officials at the premises of the producers of the imported products in the exporting
countries. This applies once for processed food and every time for raw food (e.g. meat
such as chicken or beef). The special characteristic of Halal food inspection is arguably a
system that applies risk management principles. For the DAA, physical inspection is
conducted due to strict requirements applied by the department on imports of raw food
or vegetables. For example, consignments containing imported raw beef meat from India
are inspected for every consignment, but consignments containing imported raw beef
meat from Australia are inspected only once over a period of time (e.g. once every 3
months). The RCED and all major agencies therefore apply risk management systems, but
the systems are not yet fully integrated.

34

Consistent with the application of the risk-based approach for the arrival of imports, the
RCED implements post-clearance audit. The HFCD does not implement post-clearance
audits, but this is not necessary because -- as explained above -- the risk management
system for Halal food involves careful inspection before the importing is done. The DAA
also does not implement post-clearance audits due to strict physical inspection of
consignments from high-risk importers. As noted earlier, for cement imports, the Public
Works Department conducts post-clearance audits on behalf of the MOD. The DPS
conducts inspections under Post-Market Surveillance Activities.

The RCED allows the release of imported goods without payment. However, for the
moment, it applies only for Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs) under the Sutera Lane
Merchant Scheme. Non-AEOs must still clear all payments before the RCED releases their
goods.

The RCED allows all necessary payments for importation and exportation to be made
electronically. Payment at the DPS is still done manually. Electronic payments are only
applied to import permits for documents issued by the DAA, but payments for export
permits issued by the DAA are still done manually. As of now, electronic payments are
accepted only by customs but not by other major agencies.

In terms of a review and appeal mechanism, there is an initial appeal review mechanism
to customs (e.g. customs tribunal), but judicial appeal is not yet available.

The RCED publishes dwell time information on a monthly basis for pre-clearance, customs
clearance, and post-clearance for imports at Muara Port. The RCED only conducts Time
Release Studies (TRSs) on an ad hoc basis and does not publish them; to date, TRSs have
only been used for internal purposes. The last TRS was done for 2015.

The RCED has established Trusted Traders and AEO programmes, but mutual recognition
agreements (MRAs) have not yet been established. The compliance of Brunei
Darussalam's AEO programme with the World Customs Organization standard is currently
being assessed.

Brunei Darussalam has pilot projects for self-certification with Malaysia, Singapore, and
Thailand. The RCED allows expedited clearance for air, sea, and land cargo. Simplified
declarations for expedited shipments and packages of a value under de minimis are
allowed. Targeted traders are (i) express couriers (de minimis), (ii) perishable items, (iii)
government consignments, (iv) emergency aid, and (v) AEOs. A temporary admission
regime is implemented in Brunei Darussalam, but it is not yet in full compliance with the
Istanbul and/or the Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission (ATA) Convention.

**2.4.** **Import/Export Formalities and Coordination**

Brunei Darussalam performs relatively well under this component, but with significant
room for improvement. The RCED and most of the major agencies accept digital copies
for trade permits or other requirements. Original copies, however, are still required by
the DAA, except import permits.

35

Brunei Darussalam has implemented the NSW since 2013. It now covers all major agencies
(20 agencies) related to trade facilitation and is operating truly as a 'single window' for
importation (i.e. permits are all submitted and issued through the NSW system, not
separately by each agency and then sent to the NSW system). Processing for exportation
is not yet implemented through this truly single window system and is therefore an area
for improvement in terms of NSW implementation in the country. The link between the
NSW and the ASEAN Single Window is at a pilot stage.

**2.5.** **Issues and Challenges**

The survey results suggest that there are gaps in the trade facilitation process as in best
practices. While the structure follows common practice in principle, some key elements
are not yet maximised to deliver a robust trade facilitation system.

The survey identified the following gaps:

First, more information could be provided to the public, such as the tariff rates of FTAs
and the publication of the granted Advance Ruling applications on the 'Trading Across
Borders' website.

Second, communication and consultation with the private sector is done on an ad hoc
basis; a formal structure has not yet been established within the decision-making process
in trade facilitation.

Third, while the RCED and the major agencies apply a risk management system, these
systems are not yet integrated/consolidated. A few major agencies have also not
implemented a post-clearance audit system.

Fourth, a mechanism to allow the separation of customs clearance and release of goods
currently applies only to AEOs under the Sutera Lane Merchant Scheme.

Fifth, some major agencies have not mainstreamed electronic payment systems; only the
RCED applies it fully, while the DAA applies it partially (only for import permits).

Sixth, TRSs are done only for internal purposes.

Seventh, the NSW is fully implemented only for importation; it is partially implemented
for exportation as it has only engaged two agencies for export permits at the time of
writing.

3. **Recommendations**

The discussion on the issues and challenges presented earlier suggests the following key
directions to move forward.

First, to continue trade facilitation reforms to close the gap with best practice. This
includes all elements presented earlier in the discussion (i.e. providing more information
to the public, including the publication of TRSs; a consultative process with the private
sector; a risk management system; a customs clearance process; and the NSW).

36

Second, to increase the 'digitalisation' of document processing and payments. It seems
that this is not yet mainstreamed amongst major agencies. This is important to increase
efficiency and reduce the processing time. Related to this, it is important to ensure
sufficient investment in technology for trade facilitation, such as installing an electronic
data interchange system. This is also important considering that Brunei Darussalam is
engaging in FTA negotiations with developed countries, including the Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

Third, to move forward with expansion of the NSW to cover the exportation process. As
reported, the NSW covers only importation and only two agencies for exportation.
Considering the ability of the country to implement full NSW implementation (an NSW
with a single submission system), it should be simple for customs to expand it to
exportation.

Fourth, to expedite the movement of goods across borders by encouraging the use of an
approved simplified process such as pre-clearance or expedited clearance and selfcertification programmes.

Fifth, to increase the effort for more intensive socialisation and consultation with the
private sector and/or businesses. One clear effort that could be made is to create an
official platform for the NTFC.

Sixth, it is important for Brunei Darussalam to strengthen and conduct further reforms in
other policy areas, such as foreign investment, and possible fiscal policy to promote
exports.

##### Chapter 3 Trade Facilitation in Cambodia and the Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study [1]

_Dionisius Narjoko and Wee Chian Koh_

**Introduction**

Cambodia has a shorter history in international economic integration than other
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Member States, having joined ASEAN in
1999 and the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2004. At the same time, it has been a
pioneer amongst least developed countries, being one of the first of its peers at the time
to join the WTO. It has maintained an impressive record of rapid economic growth of 7%
per year over the past two decades -- one of the world's fastest growing economies -- and
graduated to lower middle-income status (World Bank classification) in 2016. Gross
national income per capita reached $1,380 in 2018, up by almost 50% since 2010.
Concurrently, poverty reduction has been swift -- from 48% in 2007 to less than 14% in
2014.

This high and sustained growth can be largely attributed to trade and foreign direct
investment (FDI). The share of total trade (imports + exports) in its gross domestic product
(GDP) increased from 111% in 2000 to 125% in 2018 (World Bank, n.d.). During this period,
merchandise trade as a share of GDP increased from 90% to 126%. As an economy with a
low-skilled labour force, it has specialised in labour-intensive manufacturing of garments.
Exports are dominated by textiles, clothing, and footwear products, comprising about
70% of total export in 2018 (Figure 3.1). Exports to Europe accounted for about 39% of
total exports in 2018, while exports to North America and East Asia accounted for 30%
and 28%, respectively. The International Labour Organization (2016) estimated that the
garment industry had created jobs for over 630,000 workers, mostly young women
migrating to Phnom Penh from the countryside.

Likewise, the country has seen a massive surge in FDI over the last two decades, increasing
from $118 million to $3,213 million, with average growth of more than 100% per year.
The establishment of Special Economic Zones which offer exemption from import duties
and taxes, zero value-added tax on imports, and special customs procedures (a one-stop
service where the staff of related government agencies are present to process relevant
paperwork in one place) -- in addition to other incentives such as profit tax holidays and
special depreciation provision -- continue to attract investors.

**Figure 3.1: Cambodia's Export and Import Share by Product Type in 2018**

Given the structure of Cambodia's trade, trade facilitation is a policy priority to maintain
competitiveness in the manufacturing sector. The main commodity import from China
includes intermediate goods (such as fabrics) to be used for garment manufacturing,
machinery, and electrical appliances. Expanding exports is crucial as Cambodia's domestic
market is relatively small (the population is just over 16.25 million), but it enjoys a central
location in a large growth region. It must also prepare for the time when it will lose
preferential access to Western markets. The growth of exports to Europe since 2009 can
be attributed to the preferential market access of Cambodia's garment products to the
European Union in 2011. Moreover, competition from Viet Nam and Myanmar in this
sector is going to be fierce.

Trade facilitation has remained high on the Government of Cambodia's agenda since
accession to the WTO. With financial and technical support from donors, Cambodia has
taken several steps to reduce its trade cost, including strategic and coordinated trade
strategy formulation, changes in laws and regulations to allow best practice provisions,
improvement in physical infrastructure in transportation and logistics, and reforms in
border processes such as the implementation of risk management. Sixty-two percent of
the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement provisions fall under category A (already
implemented) for Cambodia. The progress is reflected in the steady improvement in
international standing across multiple indicators.

40

International trade will play a central role in achieving Cambodia's aspirations, therefore
meaningful trade facilitation will be indispensable. The economic outlook for Cambodia is
robust, with the high growth rate expected to continue in the next few years. If this
economic performance continues, the country can graduate from lower middle-income
status within a decade. Cambodia envisions transforming itself into a digital economy by
2023 by expanding digital infrastructure (Manet, 2018) and deepening regional
connectivity in cooperation with regional partners. While the country continues to invest
in upgrading its human capital, expanding international trade by reducing trade costs,
especially the transaction costs of compliance with regulation and procedures, will be
crucial for the country to generate jobs with decent wages. Improving the access of small
and medium-sized enterprises to international markets will be an important policy tool to
continue Cambodia's social development.

**Secondary indicators of trading environment**

An important contributory factor in Cambodia's economic performance is the
government's ongoing effort to foster a business-friendly economic environment. Over
the past decade, Cambodia has been able to solve many of the basic problems. Its
progress is reflected in improvements in international rankings such as the World Bank's
Ease of Doing Business and Logistics Performance Index indicators.

In the 2018 World Bank's Ease of Doing Business trading across borders indicator,
Cambodia's distance to the frontier score was 67.28, implying that Cambodia was
32 percentage points behind international best practices. This is an increase from 49.8 in
2006, although the score has not changed since 2015. Its rank of 108 on this measure is
actually better than its overall rank of 135 across all Ease of Doing Business components.
One of the key reforms highlighted by the Doing Business report on Cambodia is the
elimination of pre-shipment inspections in 2011, reducing the time and monetary costs of
the import and export of goods.

Nonetheless, export and import costs are still high. In 2018, the total time to export was
180 hours for exports and 140 hours for imports (World Bank, 2018b). The high time-cost
of trade was mostly due to documentary compliance, which reportedly took 132 hours
for both imports and exports. However, the border compliance time was much higher for
exports (48 hours) than imports (8 hours). These numbers are based on an analysis of the
procedures involved in the export of apparel and clothing accessories, knitted or
crocheted (HS code 61) to the United States via Sihanoukville port; and the import of parts
and accessories of motor vehicles (HS 8708) from Thailand via Poipet border crossing.

On the international Logistics Performance Index, Cambodia achieved its highest rank of
98 in 2018, compared with 129 in 2010, showing steady improvement over time. The
perception of customs has also improved, although it saw a slight decline from a peak in
2014. The largest improvements in this period were recorded in the perception of
customs processes (rank 95 to 77), international shipments (rank 146 to 52), and
timeliness (rank 132 to 73).

41

The World Bank's Enterprise Survey also reveals some issues in the trading environment.
Customs clearance was reported to be quicker than average in the East Asia and Pacific
region, with 5 days for exports and 2 days for imports, but the broader business
environment was still problematic. Firms reported that it takes on average 16 days to
obtain an import licence, which is slightly better than the East Asia and Pacific average of
22 days. On the other hand, obtaining operating licences took 33 days, much higher than
the East Asia and Pacific average. Another major issue was informal payments, with 65%
of firms experiencing at least one request. This is much higher than the East Asia and
Pacific average of 16%. According to the 2016 survey, the majority of firms' opinions is
that 'practices of the informal sector' ranked as the top problem in the business
environment (World Bank, 2017a). A large percentage of firms in Cambodia report
experiencing unfair competition from unregistered or informal firms.

While the Enterprise Survey reveals problems, it also highlights impressive improvement.
Just a few years ago, the majority of businesses mentioned 'access to electricity' and
'macroeconomic uncertainty' as major constraints (World Bank, 2014). This means that
Cambodia has been able to solve most of its basic infrastructural problems and needs to
focus on other issues. These issues are more abstract and therefore difficult to solve. They
will require stronger resolve from the policymakers.

**Trade environment and procedures**

The trading process is clearly explained in the National Trade Repository. A trader wishing
to import or export must register with the Department of Business Registration (Ministry
of Commerce), obtain a tax identification number from the General Department of
Taxation (Ministry of Economy and Finance), and submit the required documents to the
General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE). For some restricted or controlled
commodities, special permits from the relevant ministries are needed.

The import and export of goods subject to sanitary and phytosanitary measures are
covered separately by special regulations. Traders may be required to obtain licences and
permits from the relevant ministries/institutions. Such licences and permits are issued by
the General Directorate of Animal Health and Production and the General Directorate of
Agriculture, while the licence or certificate on the quality and safety of agriculture is
issued by the Department of Agro-Industry (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries). Certificates of origin are issued by the Export--Import Department, Ministry of
Commerce.

Some 1,537 tariff lines are restricted or prohibited. The list of restricted or prohibited
goods can be found on the customs website. [2] The import and export of restricted goods
requires traders to register at the relevant ministry, and obtain licences (specifying the
volume/quantity and time frame) or permits (per consignment). Eleven ministries are
involved in the regulation of exports and imports.

Most of Cambodia's exports pass through the major deep seaport (Sihanoukville), whose
handling capacity has been continuously improved over time. In 2011, it could handle only
238,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), but in 2017 the capacity doubled to
460,000 TEUs (Chan, 2018b). With support from the Japan International Cooperation
Agency, a new container terminal is under construction and is expected to be completed
by 2023 to bring the handling capacity to 1,000,000 TEUs. Phnom Penh Autonomous Port,
which is a river port, has greatly increased its capacity, with the construction of the new
container terminal in 2013, located in Kean Svay District along National Road No. 1, about
30 kilometres from Phnom Penh. The handling capacity of container throughput at Phnom
Penh Autonomous Port is around 170,000 TEUs, where most of the containers go through
the new terminal. In addition, there are two major international borders for international
trade: (i) Poipet--Aranyaprathet on the border with Thailand, and (ii) Bavet--Moc Bai on
the border with Viet Nam.

Border processes have seen a major improvement since the introduction of the
Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA), which covers all declarations and trade
volume. [3] The border processes are also clearly laid out in the National Trade Repository. [4]

Upon arrival, traders lodge the Single Administrative Document (SAD). The system checks
the entered declaration against documents already in the system, and then registers them
in the system. The registered declaration becomes a legal document. The customs
broker/declarant then has to submit two printed and signed copies of the SAD, with all
the required documents attached, to the customs officer. The status can be checked
online by providing the declaration code, date, and reference number. [5]

The customs officer verifies the declaration and checks the documents, then makes an
assessment using the system to assign processing lanes. Four processing lanes are
available: red, yellow, green, and blue. Red and yellow lanes involve the checking of
documents. Physical inspection is done in the red lane. The green and blue lanes require
no document or physical inspection, but routing to the blue lane is only for particular
cases. Both green and blue lane declarations are subject to post-clearance audit.
Container scanning is conducted in the scanning office. The ASYCUDA automatically
assesses taxes and duties based on the declaration. After the payment of applicable duties
and taxes, the customs officer provides a release order. Then, the trader can proceed to
removal of the goods.

**Trade facilitation history**

Cambodia liberalised its economy and trade in the 1990s, joining ASEAN in 1999 and the
WTO in 2004. Accession to the WTO came relatively quickly, and many of the accession
criteria are still to be met. Growth in exports in the early 2000s came largely from garment
exports to the United States, but the economy was yet to diversify its output. The World
Bank (2017b) described Cambodia's trading environment in the 2000s as one
characterised by lack of government capacity, inefficiency in management, a regulatory
burden, and numerous fees.

With the goal of 'promoting economic growth by reducing transaction costs associated
with trade and investment, introducing transparency in investment processes, and
facilitating access of enterprises to export markets', the World Bank worked with the
GDCE to automate customs procedures at the border (World Bank, 2018a: 15). As a result,
from 2004 to 2012, the number of documents required to clear customs reduced from 44
to 10, and the probability of inspections reduced from 100% to 0.82% after introducing a
risk management system. Although the initial project objective was ambitious -- a National
Single Window (NSW) -- institutional capacity constraints made it difficult to achieve this.
The only successful implementation was the installation of the ASYCUDA under the GDCE.
The launch of the system in May 2008 in Sihanoukville was presided over by the Prime
Minister. The project also introduced risk management to the customs procedure,
distinguishing between high- and low-risk traders and consignments. The benefits of the
reforms were highly visible, with Cambodia climbing 22 places in the 2012 Logistics

Performance Index ranking. To date, the ASYCUDA has been rolled out to all 81 border
points. [6]

**Results from the ASTFI survey**

The information gathered from the responses to the ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation
Indicators (ASTFI) survey, consultation and validation meetings, and secondary research
indicate that Cambodia is making good progress in many aspects of trade facilitation.
Multiple agencies responded to the survey, a socialisation workshop was conducted in
March 2018, and validation and consultation meetings were held in June 2018.

**5.1.** **Transparency of information**

Trade-related information is adequately published on the customs website, [7] the National
[Trade Repository (NTR) (https://cambodiantr.gov.kh/),](https://cambodiantr.gov.kh/) [8] and some agency websites. The
customs website and the NTR are the primary web-based platforms for all agencies to
share trade-related information with the public. The customs website provides rich
information for traders, and includes important information not only on customs but also
on other regulatory agencies. For example, it contains detailed information on procedures
for obtaining certificates of origin issued by the Ministry of Commerce; [9] and sanitary and
phytosanitary certificates issued by Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. [10]
Traders can also access important trade-related information via a smartphone
application.

Cambodia has a well-developed NTR, hosted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance on
behalf of all line ministries and institutions involved in import/export processes in
Cambodia. The content is managed by the NTR Secretariat located at the Department of
Economic Integration and ASEAN of the ministry. The NTR is linked with the ASEAN Trade
Repository (ATR). Cambodia's webpage in the ATR provides links to relevant pages on the
NTR and GDCE websites. The NTR also offers a membership service under which traders
can receive alerts on changes to relevant policies and procedures. However, there is some
lag in updating the NTR with new laws and regulations, especially for English translations.

Unofficial English translations of some trade-related laws and regulations are available on
the Council for the Development of Cambodia website. [11] Customs also maintains an
inquiry point that caters to both local and foreign traders. One of the tasks of the

Department of Legal Affairs, Audit and Public Relation within GDCE is to 'examine and
assess... the complaints from private sector in order to balance between efficiency of
implementation of laws and regulations in force and facilitation of international trade.' [12]
Traders can also communicate interactively with customs via a smartphone messaging
application.

Although tariff information is available online and through the smartphone application,
they are not regarded as official. The customs website encourages traders to refer to the
Customs Tariff Book: 'Duty and tax rate display in this website is only information for the
public and is subject to change and update in accordance with duty and tax policy... Please
kindly refer to the official Customs Tariff Book.' [13] This may indicate that web resources
are only for reference. This was also one of the issues highlighted with the NTR, as major
agencies' changes in regulations are not reported promptly to the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, which maintains the NTR. Since the NTR is the main source of information
for traders abroad about the country's trade environment, regular updating of the NTR
would enhance trade facilitation.

**5.2.** **Communication and active engagement of the private sector**

Cambodia has a long history of communication and engagement with the private sector.
The Government--Private Sector Forum (GPSF) was established in 1999 and comprises 10
sectoral working groups that meet regularly (Cambodian Federation of Employers and
Business Associations, n.d.). The Council for the Development of Cambodia coordinates
the GPSF. The process takes place in several steps. First, consultation meetings are held
every month at the private sector-only working groups amongst representatives of the
private sector to discuss internally and agree on issues with the government. These
working groups are clustered by sector as follows: (i) agriculture and agroindustry; (ii)
tourism; (iii) manufacturing and small and medium-sized enterprises and services; (iv) law,
tax, and governance; (v) banking and financial services; (vi) transport and infrastructure;
(vii) export processing and trade facilitation; (viii) industrial relations; (ix) unhusked rice
and rice; and (x) power and mining resources. Second, once the issues to be discussed are
identified, joint government--private sector working group meetings are organised,
mainly on an ad hoc basis, to discuss problems and find solutions. The sectoral working
groups involve relevant government agencies and the private sector, and hence provide
a forum for private sector consultation with government agencies. If certain issues cannot
be solved at the above-mentioned working group level, they are forwarded to the GPSF
which is chaired by the Prime Minister.

One of the major customs stakeholder consultation mechanisms is the Customs--Private
Sector Partnership Mechanism (CPPM), established by Prakas No. 906. [14] The goal is to

improve the compliance of the private sector with customs laws and regulations. Starting
in 2015, the president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce became a co-chair of the
CPPM along with the director general of the GDCE. The CPPM comprises three sectoral
working groups: the customs export-oriented garment industry working group, the
customs export-oriented non-garment industry working group, and the customs domestic
market-oriented business working group. The CPPM is a platform for resolving key issues
related to customs laws and regulations. Consultations take place at least once a year.
However, the last meeting of the CPPM was held in September 2016. [15] The three working
groups have been meeting more regularly, and many of the issues are solved in working
group meetings.

**5.3.** **Release and clearance formalities**

The procedures for requesting advance rulings are clearly laid out on the customs website.
The application for advanced rulings must be made in writing, before the shipment has
arrived. The decision on advanced rulings for HS code classification is published on the
customs website. [16] As of June 2016 (the most recent figures available), 71 advanced
rulings were listed, with the last decision made in June 2016. [17] . The 'publication of rulings'
section of the customs website states that: 'In order to ensure predictability, advance
[rulings may be published in some manners (e.g., on the Internet: http://customs.gov.kh /](http://www.customs.gov.kh/customs-procedures/pre-clearance-procedures/advanced-ruling/)
[advance ruling decisions) with certain information that would not directly identify the](http://www.customs.gov.kh/customs-procedures/pre-clearance-procedures/advanced-ruling/)
applicant and the parties of the import transaction in question. The applicant must advise
the GDCE of any confidential information contained in a request for an advance ruling or
in a request for the review of an advance ruling to ensure that this information is not
published'. [18]

Customs practices risk management and conducts inspections based on risk indicators.
The risk indicators are based on risk profiles established by customs, which are fed into
the ASYCUDA system. The risk indicators also include the sensitivity of the product or
country of origin. Some 12%--15% of the shipments are directed towards the red channel,
although some consignments in this channel may not be physically inspected.

Under normal circumstances, traders obtain customs clearance after paying the required
duties and taxes. In some cases, there may be 'pending issues' such as disagreement over
the HS classification or pending approval from other agencies. In that case, the customs
release may be processed manually after guarantee. However, the system does not allow
the release to be processed without the customs receipt. Therefore, the process has to
be handled manually.

Cambodia has a Trusted Trader programme called the 'Best Trader' programme. Details
of the programme, relevant laws and regulations, and selection criteria are available on
the website. [19] The qualifying criteria include ranking 1 in the Trade Credibility
Management System; registered capital of KR1,000 million or more; no criminal
background; lack of any debt with customs; and a system in place to manage documents,
accounting books, records, and other information related to the import/export in
accordance with existing regulations. Furthermore, the trader has to be a member of the
Authorized Business Community and must be certified by the chair of the Authorized
Business Community as to the financial situation and the compliance of the trader. In
addition, the trader should have annual trade volume not less than $2 million, and is
obliged to report in any form determined by the Best Trader Management Unit of the
GDCE. Currently, the Best Trader programme has 25 traders enrolled, and there are plans
to extend the programme further and introduce an Authorised Economic Operator
programme.

Simplified or expedited clearance is operational for air cargo but in planning for land
cargo. Simplified customs clearance procedures are available for express air consignment,
goods under _de minimus_, and goods in and out of Special Economic Zones. [20] Likewise,
small-scale border traders have a simplified clearance process.

**5.4.** **Import and export formalities**

To enhance trade facilitation, customs allows electronic copies of declarations to be sent
directly to border agencies to complete the customs procedure. Instructions have been
sent to all border agents to accept digital copies. Prior to this provision, traders spent
several hours carrying physical copies from the GDCE office in Phnom Penh to
Sihanoukville. However, traders are still required to produce original copies. Therefore,
the process is not fully paperless. Declaration is done by filling out the SAD, printing it,
and attaching copies of required documents.

The NSW is under development, and when fully implemented, will improve the trade
facilitation environment in Cambodia immensely. A website has been developed, but only
has basic information on the status of Cambodia's NSW. [21] The GDCE will lead and manage
the project and be the operator of the system once implemented. As of 2018, Cambodia
has developed the national NSW Blueprint, incorporating technical and functional
specifications for the system, a governance and operational model, a procurement
strategy, and a project implementation plan.

**5.5.** **Cross-border coordination with neighbouring countries**

No border crossing coordination is operational at present. The GDCE has signed
memoranda of understanding on customs cooperation with neighbouring countries such
as Thailand and Viet Nam, but they are not yet operational on any border. The GDCE is
holding regular meetings with other countries to sign memoranda of understanding.
There are no other aspects of cross-border coordination (computerised system of transit,
transit guarantee mechanism, or simplified procedures for Authorized Transit Traders)
with neighbouring countries in place by 2018. Nonetheless, the procedures that
authorized transit operators need to follow are laid out in the Instructions on Customs
Transit Procedures. [22] These procedures require the same documents and forms as the
regular customs declaration. [23]

**5.6.** **Transport facilitation**

Transport facilitation is an area which requires major improvement. No procedures for
the issuance of ASEAN goods vehicle permits are in place. Protocols 1 (designation of
transit transport routes facilities), 2 (designation of frontier post) and 4 (technical
requirement of vehicles) of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods
in Transit (AFAFGIT) have been ratified, but no laws or regulations have been passed. The
status of both the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Inter-State
Transport (AFAFIST) and the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport
(AFAMT) is similar to the AFAFGIT -- they have been ratified but no laws or regulations
have been passed.

**5.7.** **E-commerce**

The National Assembly approved the e-commerce law (the Law on Electronic Commerce)
in November 2019. It has 12 chapters and 67 articles, covering a wide range of issues. For
digital signatures, Cambodia adopted Sub-decree No. 246, implemented by the Ministry
of Post and Telecommunications (Chan, 2018a). This provision facilitates electronic trade,
as it gives electronic documents with digital signatures equivalent validity to paper-based
documents. Digital signatures from foreign institutions require ministerial approval, and
will be an important area for international agreements.

Procedures.

**Summary and conclusion**

Cambodia's trade facilitation regime has improved significantly in the 2010s. Trade
volumes have increased rapidly, as has the capacity of the GDCE. With the introduction of
the ASYCUDA system, customs procedures have smoothened the process. This is reflected
in the short border compliance times recorded by secondary indicators. Nonetheless,
there is still room for further improvement.

Information is disseminated comprehensively through the customs and NTR websites.
Some issues remain, with the slow updating of new information and the lack of English
translations of new regulations and procedures. One way to improve the dissemination
of information for international traders would be to update the websites frequently,
especially the NTR, in both local and English languages; and for all government agencies
to include trade-related information on their websites or provide links to the repository.

Although the structures for consultation between government bodies and with the
private sector are well established, regular meetings have not been taking place at the
highest level. Utilising and improving upon current structures would be crucial to make
further improvements in the trade environment.

The GDCE, together with related agencies, should regularly conduct Time Release Studies.
Since beyond-the-border compliance times are reportedly high, understanding the
processes of major permit-granting agencies would help reduce trade costs significantly.
The design of the upcoming Time Release Studies should have a goal of uncovering issues
faced by small traders to make the process more inclusive.

The documentary compliance time remains a crucial bottleneck in the trade process. To
improve this, the government should promote the acceptance of digital copies by all
regulatory agencies as it would dramatically reduce the burden on traders. This is tied to
the development of the NSW and the promulgation of a comprehensive e-commerce law.
It is important that other major government agencies join the NSW, which would lead to
greater proliferation of digital government services and contribute towards Cambodia's
goal of a digital economy.

##### Chapter 4 Trade Facilitation in Indonesia and the Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study [1]

_Dionisius Narjoko and Firman Bunjamin_

**1.** **Overall Trade Facilitation Environment**

Indonesia's trade performance has not been particularly encouraging in the past several
years (2014--2018), as export and import growth rates have fluctuated quite substantially
(Figure 4.1). International trade has played an important role in growth performance, at
around 40% of gross domestic product (GDP), but with a declining trend (Figure 4.2). All
this suggests the importance of trade facilitation as a measure to improve the country's
trade performance in the future.

2021).

Indonesia trades mostly with Asian countries, including the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) Member States (AMS), in addition to China, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
and the United States. In 2018, although 23% ($41 billion) of Indonesia's total world
exports were to AMS (Figure 4.3), it imported 24% ($46 billion) from other AMS
(Figure 4.4). From those numbers, AMS are still amongst the key markets for Indonesia to
both sell its products and source its imports.

Based on product classification, $62 billion (34.6%) of products exported from Indonesia
belong to mineral fuels, mineral oils, and animal or vegetable fats and oils (HS codes 27
and 15). Meanwhile, Indonesia imported $48 billion (26%) worth of electrical products,
electrical equipment, and machinery (HS codes 84 and 85). In total, Indonesia exported
goods worth $180 billion while it imported goods worth $188 billion in 2018.

Considering the importance and potential of trade to its economy, the Government of
Indonesia has embarked on various trade facilitation reforms since the early 2000s to
support its economic growth sustainability.

Certain indicators improved from 2015 to 2018, based on World Bank data using a
methodology adopted in 2015. As reported in the table below, the improvement can be
seen in three main indicators:

53

(i) The time to fulfil the documentary compliance to export was reduced by 15% from
72 hours to 61 hours.

(ii) The time to fulfil the documentary compliance to import was reduced by 17% from
144 hours to 119 hours.

(iii) The cost to fulfil the documentary compliance to export was reduced by 18% from
$170 to $139.

These improvements are a positive signal for Indonesia, as they instil confidence in the
government to undertake further reforms to facilitate trade.

While the World Bank indicators show some improvement, the Logistics Performance
Index (LPI) scores reflect mixed results. Based on the respondents' answers, it now costs
less to trade via seaports, airports, and railways. However, the proportion of respondents
reporting an increase in the charges for the logistical element of road transport,
warehousing, and agents increased in the 2016 LPI.

54

The logistics environment improved significantly in 2016, compared with previous years,
across the indicators: [2] (i) customs clearance procedures, (ii) other official clearance
procedures, (iii) trade and transport infrastructure, (iv) telecommunications and
information technology infrastructure, (v) private logistics services, and (vi) regulation
related to logistics.

**2.** **Trade Facilitation Environment (Customs and Major Agencies)**

Comprehensive implementation of customs reform and modernisation began in 2007.
The Indonesia Customs Office took new approaches to accelerate the transformation
process that can be measured independently by external parties as an effort to increase
transparency.

**2.1.** **Catching up with trade growth by establishing Primary Customs Offices (KPUs)**

KPU offices have different characteristics from other customs offices, as these modern
offices serve a broader range of import and export activities. For example, KPU Tanjung
Priok, located strategically in North Jakarta, handles around 70% of national imports and
exports. The process of customs audit and objection/review can also be exclusively
conducted at the KPU offices. The development of KPU Tanjung Priok, KPU Batam, and
KPU Soekarno-Hatta stimulated an equal improvement in both customs service and
control. The KPUs are available to stakeholders for service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Importers may file appeals directly at KPUs instead of undertaking multiple procedures
for objections at customs headquarters.

**2.2.** **Avoiding unnecessary trade issues by expanding customs facilitation**

Along with the customs reform and modernisation, there has been a significant increase
in customs facilitation to support industry and other sectors:

(i) relief of customs duties for machinery and raw material imports;

(ii) customs facilitation for mining sectors; and

(iii) warehousing and export facilitation.

The import duty exemption and/or relief facility aims to support the development of the
domestic manufacturing industry, with a focus on power generation projects, the shipping
industry, environmental maintenance projects, the automobile parts industry, machinery,
electronics, and transportation. In addition, simple and transparent licensing procedures
have attracted the private sector to apply for warehouse licenses. In 2008, the warehouse
licenses were distributed as follows:

(i) 539 bonded warehouse licences;

(ii) 1,418 bonded area licences;

2 The improvement can be inferred from the significant increase in the percentage of respondents
answering 'improved' or 'much improved' to the changes in these indicators.

55

(iii) 33 customs duty free shop licences; and

(iv) 15 exhibition permits.

The comprehensive reform in 2007 increased the organisational performance of integrity
development, and is reflected in the rise in Indonesia's Corruption Perceptions Index
rating -- from 143 in 2007 to 126 in 2008. This improvement is explained as follows: 'Bold
reform in the tax and customs administration and the ability of Corruption Eradication
Commission to bring forward high profile cases have recently bolstered the perception
that corruption is being addressed more aggressively...' (Transparency International,
2008:20).

In 2010, customs modernisation was facilitated by establishing 28 modern customs offices
across Indonesia. These offices conduct regular evaluations to identify sectors that need
improvement. The enhancement of customs performance is not limited to reshaping
physical infrastructure, but includes improving personnel capacity using key performance
indicators and a balanced scorecard.

Following the change in the organisational structure, [3] documentation fees collected by
customs were officially terminated. This was a significant measure in reducing the trade
costs of importers and exporters.

The Centralized Service and Supervision System supports the customs reform process. It
has made the entire customs system monitorable and available in real time 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week, to support an integrated national service. Furthermore, the use of risk
management at bonded zones [4] has accelerated the customs service at warehouses.

**2.3. 2014--2018**

In 2014, Indonesia's customs were restructured to strengthen the customs administration
in delivering its services. Several initiatives were established to support the reform, such
as Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs), priority importers (MITA), Bonded Logistic
Centers (PLBs), stakeholder engagement, online payments, a joint customs--tax
programme, e-commerce facilities for bonded warehouses, infrastructure modernisation,
and drawback facilities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The number of AEOs increased significantly -- from 40 companies in 2016 to 110
companies in 2018. In the same period, the number of MITAs also rose from 113 to 405.
These AEO and MITA companies are considered very low-risk entities and receive special
treatment from customs for their trade activities. AEO status allows these companies to
submit their documents in a paperless manner, without physical examination by customs
authorities, suggesting that the trade facilitation environment has improved and that this
has been noticed by the private sector. In the future, the customs administration could

goods to be processed or combined before being exported or imported. Imported goods stored in the
bonded zone are subject to duty suspension.

56

encourage more companies to participate in the AEO and MITA programmes to achieve
faster customs clearance.

Another programme to promote trade facilitation is the establishment of Pusat Logistik
Berikat Generasi 1 (PLB G1), [5] launched by the President of Indonesia in March 2016, which
was followed by the Pusat Logistik Berikat Generasi 2 (PLB G2) in March 2018. The PLB
improves cost-efficiency through reductions in storage fees, freight costs, and lead time.
The programme has also attracted investors to relocate their warehouses to Indonesia at
a lower operating cost.

Based on 2017 performance achievement indicator data, [6] the performance of customs
was very satisfactory. Dwell time, as an indicator of clearance performance, showed good
results -- customs surpassed the target of 1.00 day to 0.87 day. Another indicator that
showed the good achievement of customs is its trade facilitation, which reached 2.72 (on
a scale of 4.00), higher than the target of 2.00.

In terms of law enforcement, customs also showed remarkable results in 2018. A total of
1,834 operations were targeted for fraud in trade of excise goods (e.g. tobacco) and
2,221 operations were executed, leading to 4,838 cases of illegal excise in 2018. In other
words, the enforcement and control of illegal excise goods exceeded the target of 121%
in 2018 (DJBC, 2018). This reflects the role of customs in generating growth in domestic
industry, creating healthy competition, supporting the growth of SMEs, and optimising
government revenue.

State revenue, which was in line with the increase in importers' compliance with
regulations, showed good results. Customs collected 102% of the targeted revenue in
2017. Furthermore, based on a stakeholder satisfaction survey, the index score of 4.38
(on a scale of 5.00) exceeded the target of 4.06% in the same year. Stakeholder
compliance also showed a significant improvement, at 95.24%, which was higher than the
target of 80.00%. These are the results of significant efforts such as integrity declarations
with other agencies, joint task forces, simplifying permits and restrictions, shifting from
border permits to post border permits based on risk management, collaboration with the
Directorate General of Tax for joint analysis, and joint audits.

The results of the customs reform programme can be seen through indicators issued by
international independent bodies such as the World Bank. By 2018, Indonesia was ranked
72 on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index (World Bank, 2018), an improvement
of 19 places from the previous rank of 91 in 2017. One contribution to the improved rank
was the improvement in customs performance, especially after the application of a single
billing system which facilitates trading transactions across borders. A future focus for
customs is ongoing efforts to lower trade costs by decreasing the dwell time and
simplifying procedures.

**3.** **Results from the ASFTI Survey**

A questionnaire survey was conducted with government agencies during the first half of
2018 on five components: (i) transparency and information on laws, regulations, and
procedures; (ii) communication with and active engagement of the private sector; (iii)
release and clearance formalities; (iv) import/export formalities and coordination; and
(v) transport facilitation. The results of the survey are summarised below.

**3.1.** **Transparency and Information on Laws, Regulations, and Procedures**

Indonesia's performance under this component is impressive. Access to information on
customs-related matters is generally high in Indonesia. However, some information is
available only in Bahasa. Information relevant for trade (e.g. HS codes and free trade
agreement (FTA) tariffs) and all export--import regulations may be accessed via the
customs website as well as the Indonesia National Single Window (INSW). HS codes are
available not only for the current system (i.e. HS 2017) but also for the previous system
(i.e. HS 2012) and older iterations (i.e. those that applied before HS 2012) -- making it
easier for traders to classify their traded goods. Tariffs are available for the most favoured
nation/World Trade Organization rates and FTAs that Indonesia has signed (e.g. ASEAN
Free Trade Area, ASEAN--Australia--New Zealand Free Trade Area, ASEAN--China Free
Trade Area, ASEAN--India Free Trade Area, ASEAN--Japan Comprehensive Economic
Partnership, ASEAN--Korea Free Trade Area, and Indonesia--Pakistan Preferential Trade
Agreement). Services for enquiries from the public are also rated very high for customs,
through a single-point contact centre called 'Bravo Customs' and a number of social media
contact points. The call which can be accessed through the INSW portal (INSW, n.d.). The
NTR includes information on all tariff and non-tariff measures by all nine elements [7]
required/agreed at the ASEAN level. Information at the micro level could be improved by
aligning the non-tariff measures according to the latest classification of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, n.d.). The public has
increasingly used the NTR to acquire information from all agencies involved in
international trade. All the information is centralised for public information in the NTR.
However, more detailed explanations or English translations are not yet available in the
repository system. This is another area of improvement for the future.

**3.2.** **Communication with and Active Engagement of the Private Sector**

No official mechanism is in place for communication with the private sector for the
consultation process and information dissemination, as in the usual practice in other
countries (i.e. a national trade facilitation committee). Consultations are done on ad hoc
basis -- upon request or on a needs basis -- and tend to be less structured and less
organised, although customs conducts such meetings up to eight times a year. A
committee is being developed, and should be headed by the Coordinating Ministry for

7 The nine elements are (i) tariff nomenclature; (ii) most favoured nation and preferential tariffs; (iii) rules of
origin; (iv) non-tariff measures; (v) national trade and customs laws; (vi) rules, procedures, and documentary
requirements; (vii) administrative rulings; (viii) best practices in trade facilitation; (ix) a list of authorised
AMS traders.

58

Economic Affairs. In its absence, the consultation process is carried out through the ad
hoc meetings, which cover not only the major or large traders but also SMEs.

**3.3.** **Release and Clearance Formalities**

Indonesia performs quite well under this component, despite some variations amongst
its indicators. Decisions on advance rulings are restricted to applicants and are not
published. The exclusivity of advance ruling decisions -- while arguably sensible because
the export--import transaction can be unique (transaction-specific) -- is not yet in
accordance with best practice, where advance ruling decisions are made public, as in the
WCO guidelines on advance rulings (WCO, 2018).

Pre-arrival (import) and pre-departure (export) formalities are moderately high for
Indonesia. Pre-arrival document processing for imports is available; [8] and Trusted Traders
(i.e. MITAs) and AEOs have a facility to expedite processing. However, it covers only the
major ports (i.e. Tanjung Priok Port, Belawan Port, Tanjung Perak Port, Tanjung Emas Port,
and Soekarno-Hatta Airport) and is restricted to air and sea cargo.

Customs uses risk management practices applied by customs administrations in other
countries, i.e. assessing import goods by applying random inspections or based on risk
factors. [9] In line with the processing of pre-arrival documents, MITAs and AEOs receive
preferential treatment -- allowing inspections to be done at traders' warehouses rather
than the customs facility.

Consistent with the application of a risk-based approach for the arrival of imports --
instead of a transaction-based approach -- customs implements a post-clearance audit
system. This consists of the audit of financial records and the audit of the trade
documentation.

For the separation the release of goods from customs and the clearance of importation
documents, the mechanism of releasing goods early (without payment of duties or taxes,
with minimum documentation) has been established, allowing the seamless movement
of goods, especially if the goods are intermediate inputs for production use. [10] Further
improvement could be made by removing the guarantee that allows the early release,
although the impact of this should be minimal.

All importation and exportation payments may be made electronically (e-payments). This
follows the global practice of putting all payments into a single bill issued by customs. [11]
Indonesia also follows the global practice of a customs review and a judicial appeal to the

8 This is reflected in Article 6 of the DGCE Decree No. 16/2016 dated 29th April 2016 on Release of Import for
Home Use.
9 The following regulations govern risk management: Article 3 of Customs Act No. 17/2006 dated 15th
November 2006, Article 24 of the DGCE Decree No. 16/2016, and DGCE Decree No. 16/2016 (for physical
inspection).
10 The mechanism is reflected in the Minister of Finance Decree No. 167/2015 dated 3rd September 2015 on
The suspension of Customs Duties for Home Use.
11 This is governed by the Minister of Finance Decree No. 40/2016 dated 22nd March 2016 on The Electronic
Payment for Customs Duties; c.q. DGCE Decree No. 33/2016 dated 1 [st] August 2016 on The Electronic
Payment for Customs Duties.

59

courts (i.e. Tax Court for Indonesia). [12] Traders may submit objections regarding the
valuation of the tariff duty and other non-tariff payments, imposition of fines, and
imposition of export duty.

Customs has implemented two globally used indicators -- dwell time and the Time Release
Study (TRS) -- to measure its performance in releasing goods. Customs conducts these
measurements regularly and, more importantly, makes them publicly available, providing
a self-discipline mechanism to improve clearance procedures. Dwell time is recorded on
a monthly basis for all major ports (i.e. Belawan Port, Tanjung Priok Port, Tanjung Perak,
and Tanjung Emas). The TRS is conducted biennially or annually, but only for the main
ports at present (i.e. Bitung Port, Entikong Port, Tanjung Emas Port, Dwikora Port, and
Soekarno-Hatta Port). Customs plans to expand the implementation of the TRS to other
major ports, supplementing the dwell time statistics already available for these ports.

Customs has established the Trusted Traders (MITA) and AEO programmes, and signed a
mutual recognition agreement for the Trusted Traders and AEOs with Korea. [13] Currently,
Indonesia is exploring the possibility of future mutual recognition agreements with Hong
Kong, the United Arab Emirates, China, Japan, and Malaysia.

Self-certification is available, but only to certified manufacturers or certified exporters
(not both), while the simplified procedure currently applies only to sea and air cargo.
Improvement could be achieved by extending the self-certification mechanism to cover
both certified manufacturers and exporters, and extending the simplified procedure to
land cargo.

**3.4.** **Import/Export Formalities and Coordination**

Indonesia performs quite well under this component. The system for international trade
in Indonesia accepts digital copies for all document requirements. Paper documentation
is also accepted, providing some flexibility for traders. Currently, Indonesia has also
implemented electronic certificate of origin data exchange for Form D of the ASEAN Trade
in Goods Agreement, Form AK of the ASEAN--Korea Free Trade Area (bilateral scheme with
Korea), and Form E of the ASEAN--China Free Trade Area (bilateral scheme with China).
An improvement could be made in the future by allowing the certificate of origin rather
than Form D, Form AK, and Form E to be exchanged in its electronic form.

The INSW is fully implemented. It was initiated at the end of 2007, and by 2018 covered
customs and 15 major agencies. The INSW covers more than 90% of Indonesia's
international trade, and the government aims to increase the coverage to 100% by
September 2018 by mandating the implementation of trade through the INSW in 92
customs and excise service offices (at the beginning of 2018, the INSW was implemented

12 The mechanism is established by the following regulations, including the procedure to submit the
objection: Chapter XII of Customs Act No. 17/2006, the Minister of Finance Decree No. 51/2017 dated 11 [th]
April 2017 on Customs Objection, and Law No. 14/2002 dated 12 [th] April 2002 on Tax Court.
13 The Minister of Finance Decree No. 211/2016 dated 29th December 2016 on the Trusted Traders (MITA),
while the Minister of Finance Decree No. 227/2014 dated 17 [th] December 2017 on the Authorized Economic
Operators (AEOs).

60

in 22 customs and excise service offices and is expected to expand to another 70 customs
and excise service offices). The INSW covers exports and imports (not transit and transshipment); and allows the major documents needed to clear trade (i.e. export permits,
import permits, certificates of origin (Form D), licences, import declarations, and other
documents (e.g. quota reduction)). The submission of manifest is not yet included in the
system. Traders still have to apply for permits through each ministry/agency system, and
they submit all the permits to the INSW for the goods clearance process.

**3.5.** **Trade Facilitation**

Indonesia performs well under this component. Cross-border coordination (i.e. the
institutional and operation arrangement) is another important aspect of trade facilitation.
Customs has agreements with neighbouring countries (i.e. Malaysia, Timor Leste, and
Papua New Guinea) for cross-border coordination and collaborates officially with other
relevant agencies in the country (i.e. Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Trade, and
Directorate General of Immigration) for the implementation of these agreements. In
terms of operations, it covers the alignment of working hours and joint controls between
the customs administrations of Indonesia and the neighbouring countries. However, for
the issuance of cross-border permits for vehicles transporting goods, it is still in the pilot
stage.

As for the implementation of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of
Goods in Transit, two out of three protocols under the agreement have been
operationalised while the other two agreements (the ASEAN Agreement on Facilitation of
Inter-State Transport and the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport)
have yet to be operationalised by Indonesia.

**3.6.** **E-Commerce**

Indonesia's performance under this component is moderate and needs improvement. At
the time of the study, a legal framework governs some aspects of e-commerce
transactions but not all of them. For the revenue framework indicator for e-commerce
international transactions, Indonesia still follows the _de minimis_ rule, which is not part of
an e-commerce legal framework.

**4.** **Recommendations**

The discussion in this chapter suggests the following way forward.

First, continue or further reform elements of trade facilitation to close the gap with best
practice. This includes making decisions on advance rulings public, providing more detail
regarding the regulation on the NTR, simplifying documents and ensuring their
digitalisation, and expanding the TRS to cover the major ports. These actions would
complete the reforms conducted earlier and make trade facilitation more robust.

The deepening or extension of institutional reforms is included here. Agencies'
organisational business processes should be transformed to optimise customs audits and

61

intelligence/risk management and to create a special unit on rules of origin for increasing
patterns of FTA utilisation. All this needs to be supported by an improvement in the
human capital of officials in the agencies.

It is important to note here that the special unit on rules of origin could be developed to
decentralise the issuance of certificates of origin, which is likely to increase the efficiency
of trade facilitation significantly considering the archipelagic nature of Indonesia.

Second, improve and ensure smooth coordination between agencies. This is important to
strengthen the implementation of the INSW toward the ideal situation, i.e. the INSW runs
as a portal for traders to obtain permits and licences from agencies. Political willingness
is clearly needed to ensure smooth coordination, not only because strong commitment is
needed but also because of the complexity of the bureaucracy and the geographically
challenging nature of the country.

Related to this is improving the quality of regulations, which could be done by
synchronising the policy approach (at agency level) between agencies. An example is the
variation in the categorisation of a firm's risk status amongst agencies; without
adjustment (synchronisation), a firm could be defined as a low-risk firm in one agency but
a high-risk firm in another agency.

Third, review and improve administrative procedures in some initiatives to improve
efficiency -- both in these initiatives and for overall trade facilitation performance.
Potential inefficiencies in PLBs is one initiative to be reviewed and reformed.

The study also recommends agencies to simplify the procedures applied in PLBs, bonded
zones, and free trade zones. The simplification would attract more participation from
SMEs in international trade, which could be done by simplifying information technology
inventory requirements, relaxing regulations on the restricted goods list, reducing
verification costs by surveyors, and simplifying the registration process.

Fourth, increase efforts for more intensive socialisation and consultation with the private
sector/businesses. An official platform could be created for a national trade facilitation
committee. Consultation increases firms' awareness of the importance of aligning
regulations governing PLBs, bonded zones, and free trade zones with their business
models.

Fifth, continue investing in technology to reach global standards used in developed
countries. This is important as Indonesia is expanding its FTA agreements with developed
countries, and in the context of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

Information technology could be developed to support a paperless environment, using
electronic processing and data sharing/information exchange amongst AMS or other
countries to speed up the facilitation process and to manage it, without disrupting the
clearance process. Indonesia could approach its trading partners to sign mutual
recognition agreements or memoranda of understanding for information sharing.

##### Chapter 5 Trade Facilitation in the Lao PDR and the Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study [1]

_Rashesh Shrestha and Phouphet Kyophilavong_

**Introduction**

The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) joined the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in 2012 and is moving ahead strongly with reforms. Owing to an impressive average
growth rate of 7.5% from 2010 to 2018, income per capita was $2,542 in 2018, more than
double its 2010 value. [2] Poverty in 2018 was at 13%, falling from over 23% in 2010. This
enviable recent performance has given rise to optimism amongst both businesses and
policymakers. The 8th Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2016--2020
aimed to graduate the Lao PDR from least developed country status by 2020 and achieve
upper middle-income country status by 2030 (Ministry of Planning and Investment, 2016).

Like many small developing countries, the Lao PDR relies on trade and foreign direct
investment (FDI) to achieve a rapid rate of economic growth. Exports have been
performing well but rely heavily on exhaustible natural resources. In 2018, the total values
of exports and imports were $5,295 million and $6,164 million, respectively, increasing
more than fivefold since 2005. [3] Manufactured goods accounted for only 26% of
merchandise trade, while ores and metal comprised 28% and fuels 20% of the value of
total exports. Figure 5.1 breaks down exports and imports by broad product categories.
Hydroelectricity has seen a major influx of investment, attracting the highest value of FDI
from 2005 to 2015 (Onphanhdala and Philavong, 2018). Altogether, there was a fourfold
increase in the value of FDI from 2010 to 2018.

Most of the Lao PDR's trade is with its neighbours, with Thailand accounting for 60% of
merchandise trade. Major import partners of the Lao PDR are Thailand (53%), Viet Nam
(10%), and China (22%). Major export destinations are Thailand (48%), Viet Nam (15%),
China (26%), and India (2%).

Trade facilitation is making swift progress in the Lao PDR. Recent indicators demonstrate
the impact of the improvements that have been taking place since the early 2000s. With
respect to the implementation of best practices, early development of a comprehensive
trade portal (the Lao Trade Portal (LTP)) and frequent use of the Time Release Study (TRS)
stand out. Other reforms have begun in earnest, with necessary changes in laws to adhere
to international trade agreements. Having added the provisions in the Customs Law, 2011,

the Lao PDR is pilot testing features such as Advance Rulings, pre-arrival processing, and
Authorised Economic Operators (AEOs). These are new provisions from the Lao PDR's
perspective. As such, authorities are gathering the necessary information from these pilot
projects as well as learning from other countries in the region.

**5.** **Secondary Indicators of Trading Environment**

The Lao PDR's trading environment shows a general improvement, reflecting the reforms
that have been conducted since the early 2000s in close partnership with donors and
international organisations such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
Table 5.1 summarises trends in some relevant indicators since 2006. A popular indicator
is the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business 'trading across borders'. [4] The Lao PDR's Ease
of Doing Business ranking in 2018 was 124 out of 190 countries, with a distance to frontier
of 63%, meaning that the country's trading environment was 37 percentage points away
from best practice as determined by the World Bank. The major issue seems to be the
time for documentary compliance, which took 216 hours in 2018; border compliance took

12 hours. After a remarkable improvement since the mid-2000s, the country's distance to
frontier has remained constant since 2015. This indicator is one of the key performance
indicators in the Trade Facilitation Road Map, 2017--2022. [5]

Another well-known indicator of trade facilitation is the Logistics Performance Index (LPI),
which assesses a country across six dimensions based on a web-based survey of about
1,000 international freight forwarders. The 2018 international LPI ranked the Lao PDR at
82, up from 131 in 2014. [6] Perceptions of the efficiency of border processes have been
rising continuously, with the border clearance efficiency ranking reaching a historical high
of 77 in 2018. Likewise, in the domestic LPI, the quality of air transport and customs
brokers were highly rated, with 100% of respondents saying that customs processes had
improved since 2015.

The domestic LPI for 2018 also revealed improved infrastructure and performance. The
percentage of physical inspections was 18%. It was also reported that 100% of
declarations were submitted electronically. The average clearance time without physical
inspection was reported to be 2 days. A caveat is that scores for landlocked countries such
as the Lao PDR may be less accurate because the scores are affected by transit issues
outside the country's border (Arvis et al., 2016). Furthermore, the latest scores for the Lao
PDR may have been helped by the growing importance of the electronics trade.

**6.** **Trade Regime**

The Lao PDR is a landlocked country sharing borders with Cambodia, China, Myanmar,
Thailand, and Viet Nam. It has 26 international border crossings and other domestic
border posts.

Based on the enforcement of measures and requirements, important trade-related
government agencies include the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Department of
Agriculture); Ministry of Finance (Customs Department); Ministry of Health (Food and
Drug Department); Ministry of Industry and Commerce (Department of Import and Export
(DIMEX)); Ministry of Information, Culture, and Tourism; and Ministry of Science and
Technology (Department of Standard and Measure). The Ministry of Energy and Mines
(Department of Mines) is also important due to the share of mining products in the Lao
PDR's exports. Other relevant agencies include the Department of Plant and Animal
Quarantine (for inspections) and the Department of Transport (for transport facilitation
and implementation of Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Cross-Border Transport
Agreement agreements). The trade-related roles of these agencies include providing
licences and permits, setting import/export fees and product standards, and enforcing
measures and product standards.

Import and export licences are issued by DIMEX under the Ministry of Industry and
Commerce (MOIC). Traders can apply directly at DIMEX or the nearest provincial office of
MOIC. Some licences are issued automatically, subject to meeting statutory requirements.
For others, DIMEX makes a determination regarding issuance. Documentary
requirements for the issuance of licences vary by products. [7] A certificate of origin is also
issued by DIMEX or other competent issuing authorities.

The Lao PDR has restrictions on a number of goods, which are published in the list of
prohibited and regulated goods (DIXEM, 2012). The goods prohibited for import and
export are listed in Notification No. 0973, Annex 1. [8] The regulated goods require import
or export licences to be obtained from different agencies. Depending on the product, the
licence can be either automatic or non-automatic. The rules on licensing are governed by
Notification No. 0076; [9] and the list of products requiring licensing as well as the list of
required supporting documents are in the annexes of the notification. If a product is not
subject to licensing or specific sanitary/phytosanitary or technical measures, traders can
import the product by submitting a declaration directly to customs. Export duty is levied
on 40 products (8-digit HS code). [10] The duties range from 5% to 40%. Besides normal
imports, goods can be imported under the warehouse regime or as temporary imports.
Certain exemptions are also available. Transit imports are also allowed.

For the customs clearance process, traders file a declaration at the border electronically,
using the Automated Systems for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) . Based on the information
provided, the system channels the consignment to red, yellow, green, or blue. Physical
inspection is required for red channel goods and document inspection is required for
yellow channel goods. The green and blue channel goods can proceed without any
physical or document inspection, but blue channel goods may be subject to further
customs control at a later stage. Duties are assessed by the system, and upon payment,
the goods can be released from customs control.

**7.** **Trade Facilitation History**

Trade reform in the Lao PDR began in earnest in the mid-2000s. In 2004, the Government
of the Lao PDR began the Integrated Framework process, a WTO programme designed to
help least developed countries integrate into the world trading system. [11] The 2005
Investment Climate Assessment and Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS), conducted
by the World Bank and completed in 2006, emphasised the need for increasing
competitiveness and improving regional integration. Improving coordination across
government agencies on trade-related matters was one of the early reforms
implemented. One of the key recommendations of the DTIS included the formation of a
permanent national body to coordinate policies across government agencies. The
National Trade Facilitation Secretariat (NTFS), an inter-agency body, was established with
a clear mandate. The leadership of the NTFS was divided between the Ministry of Industry
and Commerce and the Customs Department.

Important steps have been taken towards operationalising trade facilitation. The Single
Administrative Document was adopted in June 2010 to ensure harmonisation and
consistency in customs declarations and clearance for all checkpoints by following the
ASEAN Customs Declaration Document. By 2014, the ASYCUDA World system was
implemented in all major ports, covering 95% of trade. National laws were also amended
to bring them in line with international standards. Revision to the Customs Law in 2011
added new elements related to trade facilitation, such as provisions for Advance Rulings,
pre-clearance procedures, risk management, and temporary importation.

The establishment of the online LTP, launched in mid-2012, was a landmark achievement
in improving transparency in the trade process. The formation of the portal itself was a
massive effort in coordination across agencies as it forced agencies to share information
on their regulations in a systematic way. This highlighted the contradictions in regulations
that needed to be reconciled. It also demonstrated gaps in procedures and legislation that
needed to be filled. According to the TRS by the Lao PDR Customs Department, the
average time to clear goods at the border from truck arrival to customs release was
reduced by 36% from 17.9 hours in 2009 to about 11.4 hours in 2012 (Fradelizi, 2016).

The Trade Facilitation Road Map, 2017--2022 envisions facilitating and minimising
procedures for trade and taxation, improving services, and enhancing capacity in trade
competition. The strategy and implementing methodology include increasing the
effectiveness of the coordination between relevant departments and agencies,
integrating with domestic and international regions and cooperating with neighbouring
countries, and establishing a National Single Window (NSW) system. Key performance
indicators include a shorter time duration and cheaper import and export costs.

**8.** **Results from the ASTFI Survey**

The ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators (ASTFI) survey results are based on
responses to the ASTFI questionnaire, validation meetings held at MOIC and Lao Customs
in June 2018, and information available via various web-based sources. We only obtained
a consolidated response to the major agency questionnaire, so we were unable to
determine differences in practices across agencies. The results of the survey are discussed
below.

**8.1.** **Transparency of information**

The Lao PDR is generally performing well in the transparency of trade-related information.
The LTP provides information both in English and the local language on applied rates of
tariffs, measures, and procedures, all of which are searchable by HS code or product
description.

Information on the import and export formalities of major agencies is available online
through the LTP, which was launched on 22 June 2012. One feature of the system is that
traders can sign up for an e-alerts, which they can customise to receive information on
commodities. [12] English translations of laws and regulations are also available through the
LTP, making it much more convenient for foreign investors.

_**Private Sector Consultation**_

In terms of private sector consultation, the Lao PDR established the NTFS to act as a
national trade facilitation committee (Khounchantha, 2015). Its responsibilities include (i)
reviewing and advising the government on matters of trade facilitation; (ii) implementing
measures of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement; (iii) collecting and disseminating
information on trade facilitation; and (iv) coordinating with government authorities, the
private sector, and international organisations in the areas of trade facilitation. This
coordination body has been meeting regularly. However, there are some issues with
coordination at the provincial level, which were highlighted in the Trade Facilitation Road
Map. The NTFS has been working to expand capacity at the local level regarding trade
facilitation, through workshops. [13]

Engagement with stakeholders takes place through the Lao Business Forum. [14] The
objectives of the forum are to (i) facilitate public and private sector dialogue, including
participation by the broadest range of private sector companies, from domestic small and
medium-sized enterprises to foreign investors; (ii) ensure consistent enforcement and
transparent interpretation of laws and regulations; (iii) remove the bureaucratic
impediments that businesses encounter in entry and exit processes and provide feedback
on business-related policies, laws, and regulations that impact the private sector; and (iv)
provide feedback on draft government laws and regulations that could potentially impact
the business community and assist the government in private sector-related policy
development.

The Lao Business Forum follows a multi-tiered consultation process. An annual forum,
chaired by the Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Minister, is held every year. Steering
committee meetings are held to prioritise the reform agenda to be presented at the
annual forum, chaired by the Minister of Industry and Commerce. Public--private
consultation is conducted each year between government agencies and members of
private sector working groups. Finally, sector-specific private sector working groups meet
frequently to discuss areas of reform. The Department of Planning and Cooperation of the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce acts as the main coordinating body for the public
sector to ensure effective public--private dialogue at the Public--Private Consultation
Meeting. A recently concluded meeting highlighted cumbersome import/export
procedures as a key area of reform. [15]

_**Release and Clearance Formalities**_

The Lao PDR has adopted release and clearance formalities, following a number of best
practices in customs procedures. Pre-arrival processing, allowing goods to be cleared with
guarantee, and regular use of the TRS to assess border processes, are some examples of
good practices. Other provisions are being studied or pilot tested, such as Advance Rulings
and AEOs. Publishing the dwell time of major ports on the website would be relatively
simple for ports with the ASYCUDA system. Enhancing risk management and postclearance audits will require coordination with major agencies to develop a
comprehensive risk profile.

Pre-arrival processing is available in the main and major ports for trade via air and land
transport. Importers can submit a pre-arrival customs declaration within 7 working days
prior to the date of arrival of the goods following the same procedures as a normal
declaration. [16] Currently, pre-arrival processing is only allowed for selected traders and
allows them to declare goods before arrival. Under pre-arrival processing, duties are paid

at the time of arrival of the goods (DIXEM, 2012). However, a pilot test is under way with
two traders to pay their duties during pre-arrival processing.

Best practice risk management is progressing but has room for improvement. Currently,
it is conducted at border checkpoints where the ASYCUDA system is installed. Customs
does not conduct 100% inspection of all shipments, although they have a 5% target rate
for inspections. Customs uses risk factors to select consignments for inspection. These
factors include the type of goods, duty rate, and company profile. Considering the goods'
origin as a risk factor is currently being planned. Other agencies also conduct some risk
management, but not in a systematic way. Therefore, risk management is not fully
integrated across major trade-related agencies. This score may be affected by the
unavailability of individual responses from major agencies.

In terms of separation of release from the final destination, release without payment is
possible on the basis of a provisional manifest or declaration submissions with a
guarantee. This is governed by Article 27 of the Customs Law, which allows the release of
goods without a customs declaration if the trader deposits security in the form of cash or
a guarantee from a financial institution. In practice, traders are normally required to post
a guarantee of 120% of the applicable duties and tax, but traders need to be preauthorised to use this facility.

Customs allows payment by electronic means through the Smart Tax system, with
separate billing for all the consignment fees and charges. For the 11 international border
posts, payment of duties can be done at the bank office or in cash. [17] At other border posts,
only cash is accepted and duties can be paid at the customs cashier. The Major Agency
response was that electronic payment is possible, but they also accept cash and checks
and over-the-counter payments. For export and import licences obtained from DIMEX,
payment is also made in cash at the cashier's office. [18]

In terms of the appeal and review mechanism, both reviews and judicial appeals are
allowed. The procedures and rules governing appeals and settlement are described in the
Customs Law, Part X, Chapter 2. This information is available from the LTP. [19] Within 30
days of the relevant customs decision, the declarant can submit an appeal to the appeal
settlement committees, appointed by the minister of finance. The first appeal goes to the
Regional and Central Appeal Settlement Committee. The regional committee is chaired
by the director of the regional customs department, with representatives from the
regional branch of the department of finance, and sectoral and customs experts. If the
trader is not satisfied, the appeal can be lodged with the Central Appeal Settlement
Committee, which comprises the director of customs as chair with representatives from

the Department of Finance, other relevant ministries, and experts. If this decision is not
satisfactory, the trader has right to submit an appeal to the People's court.

A post-clearance audit (PCA) is conducted for traders selected randomly or via a risk
management framework. Major Agencies also conduct PCA, but their response does not
include details about the procedures. Article 8 of the Decree on the Implementation of
the Customs Law stipulates that the Customs Authority can conduct PCA of customs
declaration. [20] Regarding the involvement of other agencies, the law stipulates that
relevant sectors shall cooperate to provide information on business operators at the
request of the customs authorities.

Dwell time information is not publicly available from the ports where the ASYCUDA
system is installed. The Trade Facilitation Road Map includes plans to receive quarterly
clearance time reports from ASYCUDA. A provision could be put in place to make these
data available to the public on a regular basis. In practice, TRSs have been conducted for
the main port only every 2 or 3 years and the results are published online. To date, TRSs
have been conducted in 2009, 2012, 2016, and 2017 (Amphaengphai, n.d.).

Regarding trade facilitation measures for Trusted Traders, the Lao PDR is still
implementing an AEO or Authorised Trader scheme. [21] The major facilities available to AEO
firms include simplified reporting requirements, consolidated declarations, and
associated duty deferment arrangements (World Bank, 2016). The project is still in the
pilot phase, with customs trying to learn about the assessment criteria for AEOs. Mutual
recognition agreements for AEOs with other countries are in progress.

Self-certification is operational but limited. It applies for both certified manufacturers and
certified exporters. Issuance of the certificate of origin is within the purview of DIMEX.
Documents related to the application for the certificate of origin are available from the
LTP. [22]

Expedited shipment/clearance procedures are at the planning stage. According to the
Instruction on Electronic Customs Declaration dated January 2017, [23] certain goods
(e.g. livestock, perishable goods, and frozen goods) are given priority in clearance. Traders
wishing to obtain expedited release can request it from customs officers at the checkpoint
at the time of arrival or before the arrival of goods. They will have to pay the declared
value as guarantee. The _de minimis_ rule is applied.

Temporary admission is allowed but not under the Istanbul or Admission
Temporaire/Temporary Admission (ATA) conventions. Temporary importation is
governed by Article 42 of the Customs Law, which was added in 2011.

**8.2.** **Import/export formalities and coordination**

The Lao PDR lags other ASEAN Member States on documentary requirements, acceptance
of copies, the NSW, and the ASEAN Single Window.

The Lao PDR has not yet implemented fully paperless documentation. Customs
declarations are done electronically on the ASYCUDA system and some approved traders
may even file declarations from their own offices. During the declaration, traders have to
attach scanned copies of required documents. However, upon registration, they have to
print and sign the declaration and are required to bring original copies of supporting
documents for release.

Customs only accepts originals of the required documents. Major agencies also accept
originals only. Nonetheless, there is some movement towards an electronic system. For
instance, the application for certificates of origin can be made online (DIXEM e-CO, n.d.).

The NSW is regarded as being 'under development'. Currently, two agencies participate --
DIMEX (e-applications for the certificate of origin) and the Department of Transportation.
Lao Customs is the lead agency for the NSW implementation. The NSW covers import,
export, transit, and trans-shipment. Export permits, import permits, certificates of origin,
licences, and import declarations and manifests can be submitted through the NSW. The
Lao NSW website is implemented as a joint venture between the Ministry of Finance and
the private sector. The law provisioning the formation of the NSW has already been
promulgated (Lao National Single Window, 2015). According to the implementation plan
laid out in the Trade Facilitation Road Map, the Lao PDR plans to set up an NSW with five
key departments by 2019, increasing to 10 departments by 2020, and then to all line
departments by 2022. While a fully functioning NSW is being developed, electronic
documentary processes could be set up in each major agency. This would not only help
prepare for a full NSW, but also socialise the agencies in electronic document processing.

_**Cross-Border Coordination**_

Cross-border coordination and transport facilitation are limited. The Lao PDR indicated
that cross-border coordination with Viet Nam is operational, with the involvement of
customs, immigration, and quarantine agencies, and includes joint control with
neighbouring country authorities. Bilateral agreements with other bordering countries
are also in place. [24] Viet Nam and the Lao PDR share eight international border gates, seven
key border gates, and 18 small border gates. Nine border gate economic zones have been
established, facilitating trade and service development between the two nations' border
localities. According to the Trade Facilitation Road Map, the Department of Transport is
working on a single-stop inspection at the two major border crossings in cooperation with
customs, immigration, and the Department of Plant and Animal Quarantine. The facility
at the Dansavanh--Lao Bao crossing point on the Viet Nam border is already operational.

The Lao PDR joined the cross‐border transport agreement of the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS) in 1999 with Thailand and Viet Nam (LTP, n.d.). This agreement included
a provision for coordinating border crossing formalities with single-window inspection,
single-stop inspection, coordination of hours of operation, and advance exchange of
information. [25] Both the GMS Road Transport Permit, which is a subregional traffic rights
system, and the GMS Customs Transit and Temporary Admission System, which is a
subregional customs guarantee system, have been pilot tested in the East--West Economic
Corridor. [26] Bilateral land transport agreements are in place with China, Thailand, Viet
Nam, and Cambodia, but not Myanmar, according to Onphanhdala and Philavong (2018).
Working closely with neighbouring countries to operationalise these agreements will be
crucial to lower logistics costs for traders.

**8.3.** **Transport facilitation**

There are no provisions for issuing cross-border permits for vehicles carrying ASEAN
goods. At the legislative level, goods in transit procedures are laid out in the Notification
on Transit Goods. [27] In terms of electronic data interchange, they are available on either
the main or the major ports. Protocols 1 (designation of transit transport routes facilities)
and 4 (technical requirement of vehicles) of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the
Facilitation of Goods in Transit (AFAFGIT) have been ratified, but no laws or regulations
are in place. The ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Inter-State Transport
(AFAFIST) and ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT) have
been ratified, but no laws are in place.

**8.4.** **E-commerce**

There is no legal framework for e-identification and authorisation. A revenue framework
catering to e-commerce trade is under study.

**9.** **Summary and Recommendations**

- The Lao PDR has made tremendous progress in trade facilitation and has committed
to improve the business-friendliness of its economic environment. The Trade
Facilitation Road Map lays out ambitious targets and strategies. The most
important one is likely better coordination between national and local
governments in implementing decisions.

- The mechanisms for sharing information and coordinating with the private sector
are well developed at the national level. Regular meetings of government and the
private sector are held at the Lao Business Forum. However, coordination at the
subnational level is less successful and needs to be improved. The newly proposed

monitoring structure of the National Committee for Trade and Private Sector
Development (headed by the Prime Minister) in the Trade Facilitation Road Map, if
properly implemented, may be able to achieve better coordination across agencies
at both the national and provincial levels.

- The Lao PDR has adopted a number of best practices in customs procedures. Other
provisions are being studied or pilot tested. Publishing the dwell time of major ports
on the website would be relatively simple. The Trade Facilitation Road Map includes
plans to receive quarterly clearance time reports from ASYCUDA. A provision could
be in place to make these data publicly available to traders. Enhancing risk
management and PCA will also be important, but will require coordination with
major agencies to develop a comprehensive risk profile.

- Import/export formalities are a major area of improvement. The use of electronic
means to process documents is limited, including the development of the NSW. All
major trade-related agencies require original copies of documents with a 'red
stamp' and 'wet ink'. The adoption of paperless documentation and acceptance of
copies will ease the import--export procedures for traders. Some progress has been
made on this front. According to the implementation plan laid out in the Trade
Facilitation Road Map, the Lao PDR plans to set up an NSW with five key
departments by 2019, increasing to 10 departments by 2020, then to all line
departments by 2022. While a fully functioning NSW is being developed, electronic
documentary processes could be set up in each major agency in the short term. This
will not only help prepare for a full NSW, but also socialise the agencies in electronic
document processing.

- Cross-border coordination and transport facilitation are also limited. These are
priority areas for reform. Improving border processes in conjunction with
neighbours -- bilaterally or multilaterally under the Cross-Border Transport
Agreement framework -- will be necessary to reduce the logistics cost.

##### Chapter 6 Trade Facilitation in Malaysia and the Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study [1]

_Ponciano Intal Jr., Hosni Hussen Md Saat, and Edo Setyadi_

**1.** **Introduction: The Importance of Trade Facilitation in Malaysia's Growth and**
**Transformation Strategy**

With a trade to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio that has been well above 100% since
1979 [2] (reaching more than 200% during the early 2000s), seamless trade facilitation is a
major anchor of Malaysia's drive towards becoming an advanced nation. Enhancing
Malaysia's presence in the regional supply chains of major multinational corporations
(e.g. Western Digital, Dell, Schlumberger, and Siemens) entails efficient logistics services
and trade facilitation. Thus, of the five strategic shifts that comprise the key strategies of
the country's Logistics and Trade Facilitation Masterplan, 2015--2020, strategic shift 2 on
'enhancing trade facilitation mechanisms' is to: 'Increase the efficiency of trade
facilitation mechanisms particularly improvements in cargo clearance system, paperless
trading and security of trade documents. This will boost trading activities and reduce the
cost of doing business' (Ministry of Transport, 2015: 10).

Similarly, unlocking the potential of significant productivity growth as the driver of
Malaysia's goal of advanced nation status includes having a good trade facilitation regime
alongside a robust regulatory ecosystem. One of the strategic thrusts of the Malaysia
Productivity Blueprint (MPB) -- forging a robust ecosystem -- includes key activity 13 to
'improve efficiency of the logistics sector', which is broadly considered to include trade
facilitation processes (Economic Planning Unit, 2017: E-7). The MPB also 'recommends
the restructuring of non-tariff measures, including customs regulations, to ensure
streamlined processes and regulations for export and import permits and regulations'
(Economic Planning Unit, 2017: p.3-20).

The statements above show that the drive towards seamless trade facilitation -- to which
the ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators (ASTFI) ascribes -- is very much in the
spirit of Malaysia's strategies and plans towards the achievement of the national goal of
becoming an advanced nation.

This report presents secondary indicators on the trade facilitation regime in Malaysia and
the results of the ASTFI baseline study. Overall, there have been remarkable
achievements, but significant challenges remain in achieving a truly seamless trade
facilitation regime in the country, being at the forefront of global best practices in trade

facilitation, and becoming a strong pillar of a seamless trade facilitation regime in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Following this introduction, section II of
this chapter looks at the trade facilitation regime in Malaysia based on published
secondary indicators, and section III presents and discusses the results of the ASTFI
baseline study. The final section makes recommendations for moving forward and
provides brief concluding remarks.

**Trade Facilitation in Malaysia: Substantial Achievements but Significant**
**Concerns Remain**

Several secondary indicators show considerable achievements in trade facilitation in
Malaysia, but worrying secular trends suggest that significant concerns remain.

The most popularly used secondary indicators of trade facilitation are the Logistics
Performance Index (LPI) indicators and the Ease of Doing Business trading across borders
indicator, spearheaded and maintained by the World Bank. Virtually all of the indicators,
with the exception of the Ease of Doing Business trading across borders, rely largely on
the perception and evaluation of logistics professionals (i.e. global freight forwarders and
express carriers) and executives, key stakeholders, and major users of trade facilitation
facilities and services. It is worth noting that perceptions have inherent biases and
different people may have different expectations and reference points; hence, there is an
element of lack of rigour and comparability, especially across countries. Nonetheless, as
major users and likely knowledgeable at that, their views are of great interest and provide
some broad indication of the satisfactoriness of trade facilitation services in any country.

Table 6.1 provides the international LPI ratings from 2007 to 2018. The LPI uses the ratings
of logistics professionals based outside Malaysia who provide logistics-related services in
trade with Malaysia. The overall LPI rating improved during 2007--2014 but declined in
2014--2018. The indicator of most importance for the report is the customs indicator,
which covers customs and other border agencies and processes. The LPI customs ratings
declined during 2007--2014 and then recovered to virtually the same level by 2014, but
declined secularly during 2014--2018. Note that the rate of secular decline for Malaysia
during 2014--2018 was much faster than the secular decline of the global best practice
value during the same period. The secular decline in Malaysia meant that the country,
which was second to Singapore amongst ASEAN Member States (AMS) in terms of the
perception of the efficiency of customs and other border processes in 2014, slid to fourth
by 2018, following Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Table 6.1 shows that the decline in
the ratings of LPI customs is not unique for Malaysia -- all the international LPI components
registered secular deterioration across the board. This seems to suggest that there has
been a secular deterioration in the logistics performance of Malaysia over 2007--2018.

2018).

The picture of trade facilitation in the country, from the views and perceptions of logistics
professionals (global freight forwarders and express carriers) based in Malaysia, is much
more mixed and less downbeat than the results of the international LPI on customs.
However, it nonetheless indicates some deterioration over 2016--2018 in perceptions of
the efficiency of the border clearance process and of the quality of services provided.
Table 2 shows the survey results for a number of selected indicators:

- As compared to the lower percentages during 2010--2014, all respondents (incountry logistic professionals) in 2016 and 2018 answered 'often or nearly always'
on the transparency of customs clearance, provision of adequate and timely
information on regulatory changes, expedited customs clearance for traders with
high compliance levels, etc. Hence, there is virtual unanimity amongst the
respondents that Malaysian customs clearance and other relevant border agencies
have been transparent.

- All the Malaysia-based logistics professionals considered that the clearance and
delivery of imports and exports were often or nearly always efficient during 2014
and 2016. However, by 2018, only 50% (for imports) and 75% (for exports) of them
considered it so.

- There is also a large drop-off from 2016 to 2018 in the percentage of respondents
who considered the competence and quality of customs agencies, standards and
inspection agencies, and health/sanitary and phytosanitary agencies to be high or
very high. A similar decline was seen in the perception of the competence and
quality of the services of customs brokers, trade and transport associations,
shippers, freight forwarders, warehousing/transloading and distribution, as well as
all the forms of transport in the country.

Source: World Bank (2018), Domestic Logistics Performance Index, Environment and Institutions. Data from
[https://lpi.worldbank.org/domestic/environment_institutions](https://lpi.worldbank.org/domestic/environment_institutions) (accessed 15 June 2018).

- A significant percentage of the in-country respondent logistics professionals
considered the quality of the country's trade-related infrastructure (e.g. roads,
ports, airports) to be low or very low in 2018, while virtually none said so in 2014
(except for ports).

- Compared with 2014, all respondents in 2016 and 2018 noted improvement/much
improvement on the issue of solicitation of informal payments, with nobody
considering it a source of major delay (while 33% said so in 2014).

- The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business trading across borders indicator showed
a slight reduction in the border compliance times for both imports and exports for
the 2018 report compared with the 2015--2017 reports, which suggests some
improvement.

The evaluation of Malaysian customs and border agencies -- and therefore the country's
trade facilitation regime -- by global institutions and associations is echoed domestically
by the government. For example, the MPB highlights the 'lack of consistency in export and
import licensing, permit and approval processes' and 'high levels of manual input in
customs processes' (Economic Planning Unit, 2017: p.3--20). In addition, it asserts that the
delay in the implementation of uCustoms (for ubiquitous customs) is due to a 'lack of
alignment on regulations and processes across ministries and initial IT specifications not
meeting the requirements' (Economic Planning Unit, 2017: p.3--20).

82

**Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study**

Thirteen government agencies responded to the ASTFI questionnaires on the seven
components, including the Royal Malaysian Customs Department (RMCD) and major
agencies identified by Malaysia. The results of the baseline survey are summarised below.

**3.1.** **Transparency and information on laws, regulations, and procedures**

The availability of information from major agencies is almost complete, except for the
information on transit and trans-shipment procedures. Based on the responses received
from the questionnaire and consultation validation meeting with the RMCD, the
information related to transit and trans-shipment is available in Section 52 of the Customs
Act, 1967.

The RCMD has a variety of information channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
and the RMCD website. The RMCD website has a platform for the public to address
complaints and a customs call centre for general enquires. If information related to transit
and trans-shipment is needed, the public can find information/seek advice from/via the
RMCD website and customs call centre. Malaysia's National Trade Repository also
provides comprehensive information, while the ASEAN Trade Repository provides links to
relevant pages of Malaysia's National Trade Repository.

The information on export and import formalities is complete, as appropriate, for
Malaysia's other government agencies which regulate commodities. These include the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), the Malaysian Quarantine and
Inspection Services (MAQIS), the Plant Biosecurity Division of the Department of
Agriculture (DOA), the Department of Fisheries, the Department of Veterinary Services,
the Ministry of Health (MOH), and the Ministry of Finance.

**3.2.** **Communication with and active engagement of the private sector**

Malaysia has seen excellent performance under this component. It has a well-functioning
mechanism for the National Trade Facilitation Committee, as well as structures for
stakeholder consultations that also cater to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.
The Trade Facilitation Cluster Working Group (TFCWG) was established to assume the role
of the National Trade Facilitation Committee, as required by the World Trade Organization
Trade Facilitation Agreement.

The MITI is the national coordinator for the TFCWG. To enhance its implementation, this
committee is driven by the National Logistics and Trade Facilitation Masterplan, 2015--
2020 under the supervision of the Ministry of Transport. The master plan was developed
to provide strategic direction to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the
logistics industry as well as trade facilitation, in line with Malaysia's aspiration to be 'The
Preferred Logistics Gateway to Asia' (Ministry of Transport, 2015: 10). It outlines five
strategic shifts and 21 action items for implementation.

83

The TFCWG is co-chaired by the MITI and customs, and comprises members from both
the government and the private sector. The TFCWG provides a platform for closer
cooperation between the government and the private sector, and has been a very
successful avenue for the government to receive feedback from industry. The TFCWG
undertakes various efforts to strengthen Malaysia's position as a preferred regional
logistics hub, in line with the emergence of digital trade and recent developments in the
maritime ports sector. To ensure certainty of implementation, initiatives proposed under
the master plan have also been incorporated in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, 2016--2020.

The major regulatory agencies have mechanisms (mainly meetings) for stakeholder
consultations on regulatory issues. For the RMCD, consultations relating to customs
matters include formal consultation at national and state level (known as the Customs--
Private Sector Consultative Panel) held twice a year. Frequent informal discussions are
also held regularly to discuss new issues and policies, as well as joint development area
(relating to oil and gas) meetings. For micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, the
RMCD has organised roundtable discussions on an ad hoc basis; and participated in formal
consultations held by other agencies such as the Malaysian Investment Development
Authority and the State Economic Development Corporation. The RMCD also undertakes
consultation sessions relating to sales and services taxes, which include regular technical
consultation meetings between RMCD officers and private sector/accounting firms to
ensure continued support and guidance.

Consistent with the consultation mechanism, General Circular No. 1/2013 provides a legal
mandate for public consultations on new regulations. [3] A Special Task Force to Facilitate
Business (PEMUDAH) was established in 2007. PEMUDAH consists of public and private
sector membership, co-chaired by the Chief Secretary to the Government of Malaysia and
a captain of industry; and collaborates on policy, process, and regulatory improvement in
Malaysia. The responsibilities of PEMUDAH include

- identifying improvements to existing government processes and regulations based
on public feedback and global benchmarking reports (the World Bank's Ease of
Doing Business, the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report, the
Institute for Management Development's World Competitiveness Yearbook, etc.);

- overseeing implementation;

- recommending business-related policy changes to the cabinet, based on public
feedback; and

- addressing bureaucracy through active private sector participation.

Many working groups on trade facilitation initiatives have focused on enhancing the
efficiency and effectiveness of work procedures, especially to enhance supply chain
activities by collaborating as smart partnerships with the private sector. These include the

3 MPC (2013), The National Policy on the Development and Implementation of Regulations
[http://www.mpc.gov.my/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Surat-Pekeliling-Am-Bil_1-Tahun-2013.pdf](http://www.mpc.gov.my/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Surat-Pekeliling-Am-Bil_1-Tahun-2013.pdf)
(accessed 20 June 2018).

Technical Working Group on Trading Across Borders, smart partnerships between the
RMCD and Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC), and Invest KL, which have addressed
the following issues, amongst others:

- faster clearance for the import and export of oil and gas equipment (Schlumberger);

- faster advance rulings;

- faster Licensed Manufacturing Warehouse waste approval;

PEMUDAH, with its technical working groups, demonstrates good practice for public--
private partnership in regulatory reform that can be emulated by other AMS. What makes
it worth emulating is the co-equal partnership, active and continuing engagement of the
private sector, regular and frequent meetings of the task force and its technical working
groups, and the technical and secretariat support provided by the MPC. The MPC has been
mandated to review both current and proposed business-related regulations, and is
providing technical support to good regulatory practice initiatives in the country. The MPC
has high credibility in both the private sector and the government sector.

**3.3.** **Release and clearance formalities**

Malaysia receives a generally high evaluation on release and clearance formalities,
although it varies in terms of the subcomponents. Amongst the highest evaluations, risk
management, Post-Clearance Audits (PCAs), electronic payments (e-payments), appeal
and review mechanisms, and advanced rulings stood out and are summarised below.

- The RMCD and most major agencies perform risk management, with less than 100%
inspection according to risk assessment such as critical goods and high-risk
companies. Two agencies conduct 100% inspection: (i) veterinary services on
animal products, animal feeds, and live animals; and (ii) the Plant Biosecurity
Division of the DOA on plants, plant products, and regulated articles (for export).

- MAQIS also performs inspections based on international standards established by
the International Plant Protection Convention for plants, i.e. the International
Standards for Phytosanitary Measures 23, 31, and 32 are applicable for the
inspection of plants, and random inspection based on physical/clinical symptoms
carried out on live animals and fishes. MAQIS considers the risk of pest interception
in imported commodities during inspections to establish a profile for low-risk
commodities. Malaysia uses the current customs operating system (Sistem
Maklumat Kastam (SMK)) for its risk management system, which also provides
integrated risk management but with less advanced technology than uCustoms.

- The RMCD and MAQIS conduct PCAs. The RMCD conducts PCAs for selected
traders/declaring agents via both risk management frameworks and random
selection. MAQIS conducts post-border audits on selected importers in its three
jurisdictions (entry points, quarantine stations, and quarantine premises). Planting
materials, live animals, and fish which require quarantine are placed in quarantine

85

stations or premises for further observation, and testing is carried out to determine
pest and disease-free status.

- The RMCD and all other relevant agencies use e-payments. Virtually all agencies
accept online payments, except for the import and export authorisation of
dangerous drugs and psychotropic substances, which need to be applied for and
paid manually. The MITI does not appear to charge any fees for its services, so epayments are not required.

- An appeal and review mechanism is available for judicial review as well as customs
administrative review. Temporary admission is implemented using the Admission
Temporaire/Temporary Admission (ATA) Carnet under the ATA Convention.

- The RMCD indicated that advance ruling on classification and valuation has been
implemented since 2007. The procedures and decisions for advance rulings are
published on the customs website. The standard operating procedures and guides
for advance rulings on origin have been completed, and the necessary domestic
legal requirements are being undertaken for their implementation.

- Malaysia allows self-certification for the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement and selfdeclaration under the Malaysia--New Zealand Free Trade Agreement and the
Malaysia--Australia Free Trade Agreement.

The RMCD has implemented pre-arrival processing (PAP) nationwide, but it does not offer
nor require PAP for land borders. There is no specific provision that allows the submission
of declaration prior to importation and exportation by road. There seems to be not much
need for a PAP for land borders in much of ASEAN because the congestion at the border
almost always means that the border arrangements can be done while waiting in the
queue. When the volume of trade amongst AMS over land becomes more commercially
valuable, and the road and rail networks through the borders become wider and better,
the PAP may be more relevant for the member states and the private sector.

The RMCD conducts the Time Release Study (TRS) according to the World Customs
Organization method regularly (every 2 years) at the main port. The TRS result was
published in a journal in 2011, along with two exit conferences where the dwell time result
is published. The consultation validation meeting with the RMCD indicated that the dwell
time was published at two exit conferences which were held in 2014 and 2015 with the
Asian Development Bank and the World Customs Organization's Regional Office for
Capacity Building, where the documents (including the publication of dwell time results)
were distributed at seminars.

The RMCD maintains an Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) programme in Malaysia,
but a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) on AEOs is not yet in place with other AMS.
However, Malaysia has an interest in negotiating MRAs with other AMS.

86

The publication of dwell time and TRS methodology are included in the ASTFI. The World
Bank's Ease of Doing Business for trading across borders has similar indicators. They are
included in these indicators because they provide good measuring tools of the efficiency
of the import/export and customs process, and allow for in-depth analysis of specific
processes in the various ports for possible improvement and for the reduction of
bottlenecks.

**3.4.** **Import/Export formalities and coordination**

Malaysia was an early adopter of the National Single Window (NSW) in ASEAN. The
process started with the linking of the home-grown Dagang Net with the RMCD's system
(SMK) -- automating customs procedures for shippers, carriers, and third-party logistics
companies. The resulting SMK*Dagang Net handled all matters pertaining to export--
import declarations and clearances. The nationwide roll-out of the SMK*Dagang Net was
completed in 2004. In 2009, all permit-issuing agencies were linked to the SMK*Dagang
Net, which became the NSW, with the RMCD (Ministry of Finance) as the NSW lead agency
and the MITI as the ASEAN Single Window (ASW) lead agency for Malaysia. The
SMK*Dagang Net has delivered well for Malaysia since its inception, indicating the
benefits of the automation and integration of system and information flows. Based on a
study in 1996, documentation error rates fell from 40% to 5% after the activation of the
SMK*Dagang Net, while cargo turnaround times dropped from 4 days to 2 days and by
2004, to only 1 day (Chan, n.d.).

Dagang Net connects 30 permit-issuing agencies, 50 authorities, 160 customs stations,
and 10 banks. The DOA (plant biosecurity) and the MOH (dangerous drugs and
psychotropic substances) use a separate system for import permits. Dagang Net is a single
sign-on facility with online status tracking and re-usability of data, covering eDeclare,
ePermit, ePayment, eManifest, ePCO (for certificates of origin), and eSTA (permits for
controlled goods). Its architecture includes NSW--ASW integration.

The RMCD is upgrading the SMK*Dagang Net to uCustoms (Chan, n.d.), to the tagline
'Fingertips, anytime, anywhere, any device'. uCustoms will eventually replace the
SMK*Dagang Net as the NSW. The upgrade to uCustoms will include a centralised risk
management centre called the National Targeting Center for the profiling and targeting
of vessels, cargo, and passengers.

The National Clearance Center will handle the central submission of manifests and all
types of declarations made via uCustoms. It will have an upgraded call centre. At the very
least, it will allow customs to accept digital copies (which the SMK cannot do). Along with
other upgrades, uCustoms will eventually allow paperless processing via a single window,
with multiple channels, integrated application (including risk management) systems, and
end-to-end solutions, using secured identification over a secured integrated government
network. As in the case of Singapore's TradeNet (operated by CrimsonLogic), the
processing of declarations could be expected to be dramatically reduced to a few minutes
for most cargo, with much greater security and greater connectivity with the private
sector.

87

Border agency customs, immigration, and quarantine coordination is operating and
functional, but not in all border areas or agencies in Malaysia. The RMCD's current SMK
was not designed to accept uploaded documents, therefore the system does not allow for
digital copies. However, under Section 100 of the Customs Act, 1967, supporting
documents can be submitted physically or via email as requested by customs. Most of the
agencies require original copies or certified true copies. The MITI (strategic goods) accepts
a combination of copies with the eSTA (strategic goods) application as well as plain copies
for ePermits (vehicles, etc.). Paper documents (originals only) need to be produced on
demand by customs. However, the RCMD is now embarking on uCustoms, which will allow
the RMCD to accept digital attachments.

**3.5.** **Cross-border coordination and transit facilitation**

Similar to many AMS, Malaysia needs to improve its performance under this component,
although the results are varied and it is performing well in some indicators.

There is border agency institutional coordination, as the RMCD is one of the implementing
agencies under the cross-border transport agreement between Malaysia and Thailand of
2018. Border-crossing operational coordination is also in place, as the RMCD conducts
cross-border coordination with neighbouring countries and aligns working hours with
neighbouring country authorities. In addition, MAQIS and the MOH carry out extensive
operational cross-border coordination (joint controls).

A computerised transit system is being pilot tested under the ASEAN Customs Transit
System (ACTS). A computerised transit guarantee mechanism is also in place, with crossborder exchange of data. Malaysia provides simplified procedures for authorised transit
traders on the Bukit Kayu Hitam border with Thailand and at Johor (Bangunan Sultan
Iskandar and Kompleks Sultan Abdul Bakar) with Singapore. The simplified procedures are
as determined by the contracting parties (Malaysia and its two neighbours).

Transit operations are of relatively low policy priority, perhaps because the demand from
the private sector is not strong. In addition, ACTS is still effectively in the pilot stage. When
it becomes fully operational, there will be a marked increase in the scores for transitrelated variables, including cross-border operational coordination. To date, Malaysia has
given much more focus to cross-border institutional coordination.

**3.6.** **Transport facilitation**

Malaysia has ample opportunities for improvement under this component. It is currently
involved in the implementation of ACTS for Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. The
issuance of ASEAN Goods Vehicle Cross-Border Permits will be implemented in the ACTS
pilot phase by the three pilot countries.

Malaysia has signed the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT)
and is undertaking further deliberations on domestic legal requirements for the
implementation of the AFAMT with relevant stakeholders. The AFAMT will be ratified
when the domestic law provision is passed. On the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the
Facilitation of Inter-State Transport (AFAFIST), the Ministry of Transport is still

88

undertaking the domestic process to ratify the AFAFIST. Moreover, the procedures for the
issuance of ASEAN Goods Vehicle Cross-Border Permits are in the pilot phase in Malaysia.

An electronic data interchange and port community have been established and put in
place at the federal ports. Port Klang and Johor Port have also developed their respective
internal systems to increase efficiency at the ports.

**3.7.** **E-commerce**

Malaysia is well ahead of many AMS on this front. The legal framework for e-identification
and authorisation has been established and is operational at the national level. The legal
framework for a domestic and cross-border e-commerce dispute settlement mechanism
has been operationalised, including an online dispute resolution system to facilitate the
resolution of claims over e-commerce transactions.

On revenue collection for cross-border e-commerce, Malaysia has undertaken a study on
an appropriate revenue collection model for e-transactions (i.e. vendor collection model
or account-based revenue collection model). However, harmonisation at the ASEAN
region level is still being considered.

**Key Recommendations**

An important recommendation is the full and accelerated implementation of uCustoms,
as mentioned under strategic shift 2 of Malaysia's Logistics and Trade Facilitation Plan,
2015--2020.

The ASW and the ASEAN Trade Repository should be made fully operational and in sync
with the NSW and the National Trade Repository to contribute to seamless trade
facilitation in the region. Signing and implementing bilateral MRAs on AEOs with other
AMS would further the seamlessness of trade facilitation in the region. Finally, the
implementation of self-certification could be expanded to reduce the transaction cost of
obtaining certificates of origin, thereby encouraging greater intra-ASEAN trade.

Some issues are pending, including the publication of the rules and procedures for transit
trade on the customs website, implementation of advance rulings for origin,
implementation of paperless trade (with uCustoms), and more regular publication of the
dwell time and TRS.

As an important leader of ASEAN, Malaysia should accelerate the implementation of the
ASEAN transport facilitation agreements (i.e. the AFAFIST, the ASEAN Framework
Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit Protocols 1 and 2, the AFAMT, and the
ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Passengers
by Road Vehicles).

Full operationalisation of ACTS would not only improve the scoring but, more importantly,
the environment for Malaysia's transit and cross-border trade with its neighbours.
Malaysia should strengthen its cross-border coordination with bordering countries. It
should also study and undertake bilateral agreements with bordering AMS for simplified

89

or expedited clearance on land border crossings, similar to the Malaysia--Thailand
agreement on perishables. Moreover, it should study and implement early release based
on provisional documentation or incomplete manifests for AEOs and possibly Trusted
Traders.

Malaysia should also strongly support the ASEAN Work Programme on Electronic
Commerce, 2017--2025, for a revenue collection framework, online dispute settlement,
etc., to help prepare the country and the region for the challenges and opportunities of
e-commerce and the overall digital revolution that is occurring in the world.

The implementation of the above-mentioned recommendations would need to be in
tandem with enhanced national initiatives to strengthen logistics and infrastructure
connectivity, as well as related regulatory reforms, in order to have a significant benefit
on the country, e.g. the Logistics and Trade Facilitation Masterplan to improve last mile
connectivity to Port Klang, etc.

It is also important to examine the TRS results, dwell time data (data to be culled from the
Northport and Westport of Port Klang), and time to permit approval (data to be culled
from Dagang Net) for Malaysia, given the availability of data, in order to study the
relationship with the ASTFI indicators and other trade facilitation indicators, as a
preliminary test for the 2020/2021 assessment.

##### Chapter 7 Trade Facilitation in Myanmar and the Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study [1]

_Doan Thi Thanh Ha and Pa Pa_

**Overview of the Trade Facilitation Environment**

Since 2011, Myanmar has conducted comprehensive reforms of macroeconomic policies
and the trade-related regulatory system in line with international commitments. The
country has established cooperation with international organisations such as the World
Trade Organization (WTO), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the
Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation. These
reforms aim to enhance both domestic economic development and economic integration.

As a result, Myanmar has achieved a significant improvement in economic performance.
Average gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2013--2018 reached 7%, making the
country one of the fastest growing economies in Southeast Asia. Trade openness,
measured as the total export and import value over GDP, has shown a steady rise. The
ratio of trade to GDP increased by about 12% from 2013 to 45% in 2018 (Figure 7.1).

ASEAN and China are Myanmar's largest trading partners. In 2018, Myanmar's exports to
ASEAN ranked second after exports to China, contributing as much as 33% of total exports.
ASEAN is also a major import source for Myanmar, accounting for 45% of total imports
(Figures 7.2 and 7.3).

The importance of improving the trade environment is well recognised in Myanmar. The
Government of Myanmar has cooperated closely with concerned line ministries to
implement a series of reforms to enhance Myanmar's competitiveness and competence
in trade facilitation. For example, the country's first WTO Trade Policy Review, conducted
in 2014, was an excellent opportunity for other WTO members to improve their
understanding of Myanmar's trade and investment policies. The government ratified the
WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement in December 2015 and established the National Trade
Facilitation Committee to implement the agreement. The Private Sector Development
Committee, led and chaired by the Vice President, was established in 2014 to encourage
private sector engagement in trade-related matters. Formal consultation meetings with
stakeholders -- led by the Vice President, the chair of the Myanmar Investment
Commission, and concerned persons, including micro, small, and medium-sized
enterprises -- have been organised on a monthly basis. Moreover, the National Trade
Repository (NTR) was established to improve transparency and the trade facilitation
environment in Myanmar.

93

Myanmar's efforts to enhance the business environment have been recognised
internationally. Since 2013, Myanmar has been included in the World Bank's Doing
Business report. The country climbed steadily in the rankings, from 182 in 2013 to 171 in
2018. According to the survey on Trade Facilitation and Paperless Trade Implementation
in ASEAN (UNESCAP, 2017), Myanmar made the most rapid progress in advancing
implementation. The implementation rate increased by 15 percentage points (from 26%
in 2015 to 41% in 2017). Myanmar's overall ranking in the World Bank's Logistics
Performance Index also increased from 147 in 2007 to 113 in 2017. The customs' rank
increased from 124 to 96 during the same period.

Despite significant improvement, there is still ample room for Myanmar to strengthen its
reforms. According to UNESCAP (2017), Myanmar's implementation rate of trade
facilitation measures stands at about 40% -- the lowest performance level amongst ASEAN
Member States (AMS). The country has made limited progress in reducing compliance
costs, as reflected in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business trading across borders
indicator. Similarly, Myanmar's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index
reports slipped from 113 in 2016 to 131 in 2018.

**Results from the ASTFI Survey**

A questionnaire survey was conducted during the first half of 2018 with government
agencies on six components: (i) transparency and information on laws, regulations, and
procedures; (ii) communication with and active engagement of the private sector; (iii)
release and clearance formalities; (iv) import/export formalities and coordination; (v)
transport facilitation; and (vi) e-commerce. The results of the survey are summarised
below.

94

**2.1. Transparency and information on laws, regulations, and procedures**

Myanmar performs relatively well under this component. Although Myanmar Customs
Department maintains its website, it cannot share all customs-related information. The
information provided, except the law, is available only in the local language. The National
Trade Portal and the NTR contain customs and trade-related information in both English
and the Myanmar language, but some laws, rules, and regulations are only available in
the Myanmar language.

Similarly, over 50% of the major agencies (9 out of 13) publish their trade-related
information, while the trade-related information on imports and exports of the other four
agencies is available on the National Trade Portal in both English and Myanmar. They also
share information through each ministry's noticeboard and related associations under the
Republic of the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

Myanmar's NTR contains information on six out of nine prescribed categories mandated
in Article 13 of the _ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement_ . The missing categories are
administrative rulings, best practices in trade facilitation, and the list of authorised
traders. Although Myanmar has uploaded non-tariff measures to the ASEAN Trade
Repository, currently they cannot be linked to those in the NTR due to technical problems.
In addition, the trade-related information of some major agencies has not yet been
published in the NTR's 'measures and procedures'.

The customs contact centre is restricted to office hours, while 24-hour service is available
for the Myanmar Automated Cargo Clearance System (MACCS). However, the service is
only available in the local language. All agencies have implemented ASEAN commitments
related to transparency and information on laws, regulations, and procedures. However,
the extent of implementation is not uniform across agencies. Only a few agencies have
applied internationally accepted best practices for transparency and information on laws,
regulations, and procedures.

Thus, major trade-related agencies and Myanmar Customs Department need to enhance
the availability and accessibility of information on trade-related laws, regulations, and
procedures. Bilingual websites with information on export and import formalities should
be established, and an interactive information channel should be implemented at the
Customs Department. In addition, Myanmar should aim to (i) provide a 24-hour customs
contact centre for local and foreign enquiries; (ii) share more trade-related information
on non-tariff measures; and (iii) update the NTR to cover all nine prescribed categories
with a non-tariff measures database, at a product-specific level, for all the free trade
agreements.

**2.2. Communication with and active engagement of the private sector**

Myanmar's performance is quite impressive under this component. During December
2016, the National Trade Facilitation Committee was established with both public and
private sector membership, and regular institutionalised consultations are undertaken
with the private sector.

95

**2.3. Release and clearance formalities**

Despite some progress, there are areas for Myanmar to improve under this component.
The Myanmar Customs Intelligence System and MACCS were established in 2016. Full
implementation of the MACCS and the Myanmar Customs Intelligence System is essential
for the smooth operation of the National Single Window (NSW) and for linking the NSW
to the ASEAN Single Window. In the first phase, these systems are being installed at
14 locations, including the Customs Head Office in Yangon, Yangon Airport Warehouse,
Yangon Airport One Stop Service, Thilawa Special Economic Zone, and all seaports.
Myanmar Customs Department introduced a risk management system in early 2017. The
system is still under development with technical assistance from the Asian Development
Bank.

Pre-arrival processing, publication of dwell time studies, and Trusted Traders or
Authorised Economic Operators are not yet available in Myanmar. While advance rulings
are available for classification and valuation, they are not published online, and traders
cannot request or receive advance rulings online. E-payments are not in place for export
or import duties and taxes; Myanmar Customs Department uses a deposit system. The
Department of Trade allows e-payments for export/import licence fees under a fully
online licencing system.

Time Release Studies have been conducted sporadically, and the results of such studies
have been published on an ad hoc basis. To improve the trade facilitation environment,
the Customs Department needs to distribute annual publications of Time Release Studies
for the main ports/airports. The Customs Department needs to improve the application
of self-certification. A pilot self-certification scheme is being implemented.

Customs and major agencies have performed risk management operations according to
best practice, but the procedure is still not consolidated/integrated. Customs permits the
early release of goods without payment on the basis of both a completed manifest and
declaration submissions with guarantee. Customs implements post-clearance audits in
compliance with best practice.

Simplified or expedited clearance is available for air and sea cargo, but not yet for land
cargo. Temporary admission is only allowed for certain goods, with total conditional relief
from duties and taxes granted. It is not in full compliance with the Istanbul and/or
Admission Temporaire--Temporary Admission (ATA) conventions. Appeals and review
mechanisms are in place within the judicial authority.

**2.4.  Import/Export formalities and coordination**

Myanmar lags behind other AMS under this component. In principle, customs and
regulatory agencies in Myanmar still request original copies to process any application. It
would help improve trade facilitation if customs and other regulatory agencies were to
accept photocopies or electronic copies for all documentary requirements. The NSW has
not been implemented and therefore is not yet linked to the ASEAN Single Window.

96

Coordination amongst border agencies (e.g. customs, immigration, and quarantine) has
been set up but only at major ports on an ad hoc basis.

**2.5.  Cross-border coordination and transit facilitation**

Myanmar's performance is rather low under this component. Institutional coordination
by border agencies with neighbouring countries exists, but not all border and regulatory
agencies are involved. Only the departments responsible for quarantine practise border
agency institutional coordination with neighbouring countries. The Department of
Agriculture (DOA) has been practising border agency institutional coordination with
Thailand for the issuance of sanitary and phytosanitary certificates. The Livestock
Breeding and Veterinary Department (LBVD) has also set up a trans-border institutional
arrangement for border agency coordination with border countries. Other major agencies
such as customs and immigration have not yet implemented border agency coordination.

In terms of operational coordination, border agencies (both the DOA and the LBVD under
the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation) practise one of three border-crossing
coordination components: (i) sharing common facilities, (ii) joint controls with
neighbouring country authorities, and (iii) alignment of working hours between
neighbouring country authorities. [2]

**2.6.  Transport facilitation**

Myanmar's transport facilitation lags behind other AMS remarkably. It has ratified
Protocol 4 on the technical requirements of vehicles under the ASEAN Framework
Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit (AFAFGIT), as well as the ASEAN
Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Inter-State Transport (AFAFIST) and the
ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT). However, national
laws and regulations have only been developed for the AFAMT. Moreover, no
implementation structures or systems for AFAFIST and AFAFMT are in place.

Myanmar has signed Protocol 6 on railway border and interchange stations under the
AFAFGIT to facilitate the cross-border movement of goods trains within the region (WTO,
2014: 23). An integrated transport master plan has also been formulated in the country
(Swe, 2018). Myanmar will also commence the 'Early Harvest' Cross-Border Transport
Agreement (CBTA) implementation through initial implementation of a CBTA with
Thailand in August 2018 and with the other Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) neighbours
during a grace period until 1 June 2020. Accordingly, the actual movement of vehicles and
mutual recognition of road transport permits and temporary admission documents shall
commence on the effective launch date for CBTA transport operations. According to the
GMS CBTA, single stop inspection will be implemented at the Myawaddy Border Trade
Zone. For this purpose, border control facility single stop inspection will be constructed at
the beginning of 2019.

2 The DOA has implemented (iii) while the LBVD has practised (ii).

97

Although Myanmar has already ratified the AFAFIST and the AFAMT, national laws and
regulations are only in place for the AFAMT. Moreover, no implementation structures and
system are in place for either framework.

**2.7.  E-commerce**

Myanmar's performance is rather low under this component, despite some progress. The
legal framework for e-identification and authorisation is in operation. The Electronic
Transaction Law, 2004 has come into effect in Myanmar. The country is also implementing
a cyber legal and policy framework project which will cover laws and policies related to egovernment, e-commerce, and cybersecurity to strengthen the legal framework related
to cross-cutting areas of e-commerce, including electronic authentication, electronic
signatures, electronic settlement, paperless trading, custom duties, and computing
facilities. According to the project scope, it will analyse the existing legal and regulatory
framework and reports, and reflect international best practices in the draft cyber legal
and policy framework. The cyber law and policies related to e-government, e-commerce,
and cybersecurity are planned to be implemented by 2021. This project is being
undertaken by a committee comprising experts from concerned ministries, local
entrepreneurs, information technology (IT) experts, and international IT and legal experts,
with funding assistance from the World Bank.

**2.8. Main challenges in Myanmar's trade facilitation environment**

All the government agencies face several common challenges. Firstly, there is a lack of
well-trained personnel with expertise in their respective fields. For example, for ecommerce, the development of a legal framework that could support the evolution of ecommerce in Myanmar is crucial to create a better trade facilitation environment. As the
new e-commerce law is being drafted by a committee with experts from related
ministries, the availability of local and international IT and legal experts and the active
cooperation of civil society are major challenges.

Secondly, insufficient infrastructure limits the capacity for seamless trade facilitation. In
particular, the development of IT infrastructure is a significant challenge faced by major
agencies. Without such infrastructure, the sharing of trade-related information,
implementation of a paperless permit/licence application process, execution of a
computerised system for transit, development of the NSW and NTR, and e-commerce
cannot be strengthened.

In addition, development of the hard infrastructure that supports trade transactions
(e.g. ports, roads, cold storage, and warehouses) is needed. Developing such
infrastructure requires both financial resources and technology. Thus, financing
constraints and technical assistance are also great challenges.

Strengthening cooperation and coordination between trade-related government
agencies is a significant challenge for improving trade facilitation, as the domestic border
agency (customs, immigration, quarantine) coordination at the operational level is
undertaken on ad hoc basis only. Above all, however, peace and stability along the border

98

areas are important to develop the facilitation of overland trade, which has the potential
to develop in the long run.

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

Myanmar has been undertaking a series of reforms in line with international best
practices to improve trade facilitation in accordance with the WTO Trade Facilitation
Agreement and the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint. The progress of Myanmar's
implementation has been recognised. Myanmar is regarded as a country which has
achieved rapid progress in advancing the implementation of trade facilitation measures
amongst the AMS.

To improve trade facilitation and encourage private sector development, the Department
of Trade is cooperating with development partners on trade development and is
preparing a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study under the Enhanced Integrated
Framework of the WTO trade development programme. In addition, the Medium Term
Programme report of the Myanmar Trade Development Programme was launched in
2017 and has entered the implementation stage.

Based on the results of the findings in this study, below are the recommendations for
further improvement:

- The performance of major agencies in implementing the ASEAN agreements and
plans to enhance trade facilitation is still weak. This suggests that there is ample
room for further improvement of the trade facilitation environment in Myanmar.

- High border compliance times for exports and imports, and high documentary
compliance for exports, are reflected in the survey results. The trade-related
information of some major agencies is not accessible via the internet. Most of the
websites are only available in the local language. Thus, updating trade-related
information on the respective websites in both English and Myanmar would help
to improve the trade facilitation environment in Myanmar.

- The NSW should be made operational as soon as possible, as it would help to
improve the efficiency of the cargo clearance process, thereby improving trade
facilitation.

- The legal framework for implementing e-commerce needs to be improved, as it is
critical for doing business and enhancing trade. Investment in human capital
through the provision of professional training would contribute significantly to the
design and implementation of policies.

- Human resources management, customs procedures, environmental protection,
adequate credit and banking facilities, infrastructure (including transportation),
electricity, and information and communication technology are vital. A more
facilitative environment would increase connectivity and create better
opportunities for Myanmar to extend its participation in regional value chains.

##### Chapter 8 Trade Facilitation in Philippines and Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study [1]

_Salvador Buban and Josephine Nagallo_

**1.** **Trade Overview**

From 2014 to 2018, the Philippines' total trade grew at an average rate of 8%, from
$129 billion in 2014 to $182 billion in 2018. [2] Amongst its top 15 trading partners were
Japan; the United States; China; Germany; and five Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) Member States (AMS) -- Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam,
whose trade value totalled $160 billion (footnote 1).

In 2018, 16% ($10.7 billion) of the Philippines' total exports were to AMS, while 25%
($28.6 billion) of its imports were sourced from other AMS (footnote 1). The data show
that AMS are still amongst the Philippines' key partners both for selling products and for
sourcing imports. Some 63% of the products exported and 36% of those imported by the
Philippines belong to the same product category, i.e. electrical products, electrical
equipment, and machinery (HS Code 84 and 85). [3]

**2.** **Key Trade Facilitation Reforms**

Recognising the importance of trade in the country's economy and the extent to which an
improved trade facilitation environment could contribute to an increase in trade, the
Philippines embarked on various trade facilitation reforms, including the enactment of
the Customs Modernization and Tarff Act, 2016 (CMTA); the implementation of the
Philippine National Single Window (PNSW); and the launch of the new single window
platform (TradeNet). The Philippines also proposed the inclusion of the enactment of the
Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act, 2018 (Republic Act
No. 11032), under which the National Effort for the Harmonization of Efficiency Measures

of Inter-Related Agencies or Program NEHEMIA was developed to improve the operation
of other trade-related government agencies.

**2.1.** **Customs Modernization and Tariff Act**

The enactment of the CMTA on 30 May 2016 was a milestone reform in Philippine trade
facilitation. As landmark legislation anchored on trade facilitation initiatives and
measures, the CMTA aimed to simplify, modernise, and align Philippine customs
procedures with international standards and best practices. It set down basic trade
facilitation standards -- including opening access to relevant customs information,
regulatory issuances, and rulings -- thereby increasing transparency and predictability in
import and export transactions. The CMTA also envisaged full electronic processing of
shipment documents, streamlining of export and import procedures, the application of
efficient border controls based on international best practices, steeper penalties for the
violation of customs laws, and enhanced transparency in addressing the needs of private
stakeholders and the business community.

Some of the main trade facilitation features of the CMTA are advance rulings, Authorised
Economic Operators (AEOs), advance lodgement and clearance, temporary admission of
goods, expedited shipments, and the single window. Following the enactment of the
CMTA, the Department of Finance (DOF) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) established a
project management office to oversee its implementation. A 3-year CMTA
implementation plan was prepared, which included the establishment of drafting teams
and a review team that drafted the implementing rules and regulations of the CMTA.
These implementing rules and regulations, called customs administrative orders (CAOs)
and customs memorandum orders (CMOs), are the enabling regulations for the CMTA
implementation. Part of the process of drafting the CAOs or CMOs is consultation with
various stakeholders, to provide an opportunity -- especially for the private sector -- to
share its views, inputs, and comments before the implementation of the regulations.

**2.2.** **National Single Window**

In 2004, the national single window concept was introduced to major agencies in the
Philippines. The PNSW, an electronic platform for the issuance of licences and permits
fully funded by the Government of the Philippines, was implemented in 2009. A number
of government agencies (e.g. the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the Food and Drug
Administration, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, the National Meat
Inspection Service, the Optical Media Board, the Philippine National Police, the Bureau of
Import Services, the Bureau of Animal Industry, and the Bureau of Plant Industry) were
part of the PNSW. Traders apply for licences, permits, and clearances through the PNSW,
and these are then reviewed and subsequently approved by the government agencies.
For other agencies under the Department of Agriculture, the value added service provider
(VASP) system was used as their front-end system and transport layer connection to the
PNSW. While the VASP system used by agencies under the Department of Agriculture
provided more features than the PNSW, i.e. electronic payments (e-payments),
simultaneous transmission of permits to personnel in the field (as gleaned from

102

information shared by representatives from Department of Agriculture agencies during
the validation-cum-consultation), the VASP was still considered a separate system from
the PNSW.

However, the implementation of the PNSW was slow, and the usage of the PNSW by
agencies in the issuance of licences and permits has declined. Some government agencies
even reverted to manual issuance of permits. The BOC, which managed the PNSW,
exerted efforts to revitalize PNSW operations by integrating the PNSW with the integrated
enhanced customs processing system, a ₱650 million ($13 million) computerised system
project that will integrate single window operations with the customs procedures and
cargo clearance process. However, the project was embroiled in legal issues which led to
its cancellation. This situation contributed to the decline in the use of the PNSW. The
Philippines' participation in ASEAN Single Window (ASW) activities was also affected, such
as the inability to participate in the live implementation of the ASW pilot project on the
electronically submitted Form D under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreements (e-ATIGA
Form D), despite being actively involved in earlier ASW activities.

**2.3.** **TradeNet**

The DOF launched the TradeNet platform in December 2017. TradeNet operates as the
new PNSW, with the aim of connecting more than 60 regulatory government agencies. It
will be operated and maintained by the Department of Information and Communications
Technology, a government agency responsible for the planning, development, and
promotion of information and communication technology (ICT) in the country. Although
TradeNet is not yet fully operational, it has started issuing licences and permits.

The TradeNet platform is being developed as a project of the Interagency Business Process
Interoperability, under the auspices of the DOF's Anti-Red Tape Act team which aims to
streamline the complicated import and export documentation process in revenue
collection to facilitate the clearance of goods, and will help contribute to the ease of doing
business for the private sector in the country and facilitate trade.

TradeNet is an 'automated licensing, permit, clearance, and certification system
integrated into one platform for regulatory agencies', where users can submit
applications for permits and licences to comply with import and export requirements. As
this is an integrated and cloud-based system, inter-agency routing of documents will be
easier, while real-time reports and data can easily be generated to assist in risk
assessment and management as well as in conducting the necessary checks and
verification against government business registries. [4]

4 The Inter-Agency Business Process Interoperability Program team briefed the Economic Research Institute
for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) on the NSW and ASW on 14 March 2018.

**2.4.** **Trade facilitation indicators from secondary sources**

The World Bank's Trading Across Borders indicator noted improvements in the
Philippines' trade facilitation environment from 2006 to 2015, where it showed a 30%
reduction in the cost to export and a 20% reduction in the cost to import. The
improvement in the cost reductions was complemented by a decrease in the time to
export, from 17 days to 15 days, while the time to import was shortened from 18 days to
15 days (Table 8.1).

In the 4 years from 2015 to 2018, however, some of the indicators have not changed or
progressed, based on World Bank data using a methodology adopted in 2015 (Table 8.2).
This condition may call for the Philippines to undertake more efforts and strategies to
create better trade facilitative conditions.

The trade facilitation and logistics environment has shown signs of improvement from
2015 to 2018, but significant concerns remain, as measured by the Domestic Logistics
Performance Index (LPI) -- Environment and Institutions.

Despite some improvements in customs clearance procedures and other official clearance
procedures in the Philippines, further improvement needs to be made in the area of
competence and quality services delivered by logistics services providers (road, rail,
maritime, and freight forwarders), sanitary and phytosanitary agencies, and quality or
standards inspection agencies. The high fees and charges for ports are also a challenge for
the Philippines to improve its logistics performance.

The LPI revealed an improvement in the Philippines' overall rank, from 71 in 2016 to 60 in
2018. Although the ranking improved considerably, the overall score only increased
slightly, from 2.86 in 2016 to 2.90 in 2018. The increase in ranking did not extend to the
customs LPI ranking, which deteriorated to 85 in 2018 from 78 in 2016 and 47 in 2014.
This may also be due to improvements in other countries, which lowered the rank of the
Philippines.

The reduction in the international customs LPI ranking is similar to the domestic LPI score.
More than 75% of freight forwarders, as the LPI respondents, perceived the clearance and
delivery of Philippine imports and exports to be efficient. In addition, the respondents
indicated that the transparency of customs clearance and border agencies was very low.

**3.** **Highlights and Key Findings of the ASTFI Survey**

A questionnaire survey was conducted during the first half of 2018 with 22 government
agencies on five components: (i) transparency and information on laws, regulations, and
procedures; (ii) communication with and active engagement of the private sector; (iii)
release and clearance formalities; (iv) import/export formalities and coordination; and
(v) transport facilitation. The results of the survey are summarised below.

**3.1.** **Transparency and information on laws, regulations, and procedures**

The Philippines received a commendable score for transparency of information on laws,
regulations, and procedures. Information on legislation, procedures, and documentary
requirements for import and export is available on the BOC and agency websites. [7] It is
also available in the Philippine National Trade Repository (PNTR), including the mandatory
information required in Article 13 of the ATIGA. [8]

The PNTR improved over the past 2 years (2016--2018), when it started populating
information in 2017. One notable feature about the non-tariff measure (NTM) section of
the PNTR allows users to key in specific HS codes or product descriptions to identify the
corresponding NTMs regulating the product. Although this feature is not mandatory in

the national trade repository and the ASEAN Trade Repository (ATR), some AMS have
included this interface to make it user-friendly for business people who are more familiar
with the HS code or product description than the NTM regulating that product. Further
work is needed to populate and update the NTM section of the PNTR, but the foundation
is already in place.

The information on the BOC website and users' access to the website had been
challenging, but they have improved significantly since 2018. Interactive information
channels are available on the customs website, with an operational help desk to respond
to stakeholders' needs. The BOC customer assistance and response service has email,
Facebook, and Twitter accounts to send updates and news on the developments at the
BOC, as well as receive feedback from stakeholders.

**3.2.** **Communication with and active engagement of the private sector**

The Philippines received a significantly high score for this component. The National Trade
Facilitation Committee (NTFC) is the Inter-Agency Committee on the ASEAN Economic
Community (CAEC). [9] It is composed of departments and agencies concerned with ASEAN
economic and financial cooperation. The CAEC, which is led by the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI), was established to facilitate inter-agency consultations in the
development and implementation of policies and programmes related to the Philippines'
trade and economic agreements under ASEAN (DTI, 2017). In line with its mandate, the
CAEC undertakes outreach and advocacy initiatives that promote widening the awareness
and understanding of the benefits and challenges of the ASEAN Economic Community
(AEC), engaging and mobilising stakeholders to participate in the AEC building process,
and encouraging stakeholders' inputs to shape AEC initiatives that could result in a
meaningful outcome for the Philippines.

Consistent with enhancing government--private sector collaboration, the CAEC facilitated
sustained engagement with the ASEAN Business Advisory Council, which has both national
and regional level mechanisms. Through the CAEC, the DTI's Board of Investments
conducted AEC Game Plan Industry Roadmap Localisation Forums in all regions of the
country, which encouraged stakeholders to apply these initiatives and activities locally.
Through coordination with CAEC agencies, the DTI has convened hundreds of forums on
Doing Business in Free Trade Areas (FTAs) to help small businesses understand and take
advantage of the benefits of preferential market access provided under FTAs, especially
in the AEC. The forums also encouraged other private sector organisations, such as the
Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Makati Business Club, and the
Management Association of the Philippines, to follow suit in undertaking similar
initiatives.

9 Administrative Order No. 20 dated 6 September 2011 on Reorganizing and Renaming the Philippine
Council on ASEAN and APEC Cooperation into the Philippine Council for Regional Cooperation.

107

While the Philippines has identified the CAEC as the NTFC equivalent for the Philippines,
the National Competitiveness Council -- a public--private sector body that aims to promote
and develop national competitiveness -- could be a good candidate for an NTFC
equivalent, as it is a major body or forum for government--private sector engagement in
areas related to trade, competitiveness, regulatory matters, and trade facilitation. Its
structure allows for more in-depth participation of the private sector at the working group
level. It also develops a long-term strategy for a more competitive Philippines, through
public--private sector collaboration, as a vehicle to reduce poverty and achieve inclusive
growth.

The National Competitiveness Council has various working groups that address issues
related to trade facilitation, streamlining of business permits and licences, smuggling and
corruption, transport, trade, and logistics. It also has projects on issues such as the ease
of doing business, where government agencies and the private sector formulate,
implement, and track projects and policies to facilitate the ease of doing business in the
country. Another project which was launched in 2016 is Project Repeal, a governmentwide regulatory reform initiative to repeal outdated rules to reduce the cost of doing
business. The objective is to review outdated, irrelevant, and burdensome laws and
issuances which affect the global competitiveness ranking and investment climate, with a
view to eventually repealing them.

Improving on this component requires having an NTFC, rather than just an equivalent
mechanism. Therefore, the BOC (as the lead agency designated to establish the NTFC) has
assured that the Philippines will work with other government agencies for the
establishment of the NTFC. Initial suggestions from some government agencies in the
Philippines include the establishment of a working group that would assess and help
streamline NTMs, as well as pursue areas related to addressing burdensome
requirements for complying with import and export requirements.

For the NTFC to be more effective, however, it should be able to provide
guidance/direction for the implementation of policies on trade facilitation across FTAs
and other relevant agreements with trade facilitation commitments. Private sector
membership in the NTFC should be an inherent element to facilitate private sector
participation in the future.

**3.3.** **Release and clearance formalities**

The Philippines needs to work on the indicators related to release and clearance
formalities. Dwell time data are not available to the public in the Philippines. However,
International Container Terminal Services Inc., a global port management company which
operates the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT), gathers dwell time data on
containers (measured in days) and submits these on a monthly basis to the Philippine
Ports Authority and the MICT. The data, however, are only available to the Philippine Ports
Authority and MICT for internal use, not to the public.

108

There is no regular Time Release Study (TRS) publication, the last of which was in 2015.
With technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank, the BOC conducted the
second TRS in October 2019 at three main collection districts -- the Port of Manila, Manila
International Container Port, and Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Pablo, 2018). The
BOC is confident that the TRS will help identify delays in the cargo clearance process and
will be vital in providing data as the basis for corrective measures.

The BOC has an operational Trusted Traders programme called the Super Green Lane. The
programme has a clear mechanism and criteria for accreditation, including the
obligations, privileges, and benefits accorded to these trusted operators. The BOC has also
issued an administrative order [10] which provides for the establishment of an AEO
programme in line with the provisions of the CMTA. The programme intends to cover all
stakeholders of the BOC such as importers/exporters, warehouse operators, brokers, and
freight forwarders.

The implementation of self-certification for the Philippines is in a pilot stage, as in other
AMS. To improve in this area, the Philippines would require all AMS to implement the selfcertification scheme.

The implementing rules and regulations on advance rulings for valuation, rules of origin,
and classification provide that advance rulings which are issued should be fully published
and available to all traders and stakeholders. Two agencies implement advance rulings in
the Philippines: (i) the Tariff Commission on tariff classification, and (ii) the BOC on
customs valuation and rules of origin. The Tariff Commission has issued and published 310
tariff classification rulings, based on 438 applications received for rulings from October
2017 to May 2018. The BOC has not published any of the advance rulings issued, either
for valuation or rules of origin.

Pre-arrival processing, appeal and review mechanisms, post-clearance audits, and
simplified expedited clearance are available and applied by the BOC and some other
agencies. Even before the CMTA, the BOC had incorporated these in the cargo clearance
process.

Risk management is applied by customs and some government agencies. However, the
BOC removed the green lane from the cargo selectivity system on 30 August 2017 (Pablo,
2017), so goods or shipments are categorised either red lane or yellow lane. The
shipments selected in the red lane require x-ray machine scanning or are subject to
physical inspection, while documentary checks are undertaken for those selected in the
yellow lane. However, the Super Green Lane, a trusted trader programme which is mainly
being used by multinational companies that have maintained good transaction records
with the BOC, is still available (Torres-Tupas, 2017).

10 Customs Administrative Order No. 5 (2017) on the Establishment of Authorized Economic Operator (AEO)
Program.

109

The BOC and some agencies accept e-payments. A final determination and payment of
customs duties is made before goods are released from customs. Although the BOC uses
e-payments for its transactions, e-payments are not available at the airport for dutiable
goods brought by passengers. Some agencies, such as the Bureau of Animal Industry and
the Food and Drugs Administration, use e-payments. Some agencies indicated that the
establishment of an e-payment system has been difficult as they have to comply with
requirements from other agencies such as the Bangko Sentral (Central Bank) and they still
need to work on it.

**3.4.** **Import/Export formalities and coordination**

Under this component, the Philippines could improve on its performance, particularly on
the documentation requirements and the ASW. The BOC does not allow digital copies to
be attached to entry declaration filings. The CMTA does not prohibit the acceptance of
digital copies, but the electronic to mobile (E2M) customs system has technical limitations
for accepting digital copies in entry declarations. For major agencies, traders can attach
digital copies to the application for permits and licenses. Other government agencies,
such as the Dangerous Drugs Board, the Food and Drug Administration, the Bureau of
Plant Industry, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, and the Bureau of Animal
Industry, either accept digital copies or fully automated systems in their applications and
for the issuance of permits and licences.

Unlike the other major agencies indicated earlier, the Bureau of Philippine Standards
accepts digital copies and has a fully automated system for the application and issuance
of licences and permits through its Product Certification Information Management
System. The system started in October 2018 and was fully implemented in January 2019.
The Department of Information and Communications Technology has been working with
other agencies to provide digital signatures and certificates to facilitate and secure
electronic transactions. It has issued more than 2,300 digital signatures and certificates to
date.

The BOC accepts plain copies in applications for permits or entry filings, while some major
agencies accept either plain copies or a combination of originals and plain or digital copies.

Some agencies are still connected to the old PNSW -- mainly agencies under the
Department of Agriculture (through the VASP system). As mentioned above, the new
TradeNet platform is being developed to replace the old PNSW. Although not yet fully
operational, TradeNet is being used to pilot test the exchange of the e-ATIGA Form D for
the ASW. It will eventually be able to provide an e-payment facility through PhPay, a
government online payment system that enables citizens and businesses to remit
payments electronically to government agencies.

It should be noted that the effectiveness of a national single window calls for a whole-ofgovernment approach, which was not present during the previous PNSW managed by the
BOC. The focus at that time was to link existing individual agencies' systems to facilitate
the issuance of permits and licences, keeping their individual processes and requirements

110

intact. There was not much effort to streamline processes and documentation
requirements for effective and 'real' single window operations.

TradeNet, under the auspices of the DOF, may be able to perform better in terms of
managing a whole-of-government approach -- not only to bring agencies into the fold, but
also to participate seriously in an effort to streamline processes and documentation
requirements. TradeNet should not allow agencies just to 'cut and paste' processes and
documentation requirements in their own system and transport them to the new
TradeNet.

**3.5.** **Transport Facilitation**

The Philippines needs to make significant efforts to improve transport facilitation
indicators. Although it has ratified the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation
of Inter-State Transport and the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport,
the national laws and regulations to implement these protocols, including their respective
implementation structures, have not yet been established. The Department of
Transportation noted, however, that the Philippines has already organised an InterAgency Technical Working Group for the operationalisation of the ASEAN Framework
Agreement on Multimodal Transport and is formulating an executive order that will
provide for the creation of a competent national body. The competent national body will
be responsible for regulating, registering, or recognising multimodal transport operators
in the country.

The Philippines has also completed the ratification of Protocol 1 (Designation of Transit
Transport Routes and Facilities) and Protocol 4 (Technical Requirements of Vehicles) of
the ASEAN Framework Agreement of the Facilitation of Goods in Transit. Protocol 2
(Designation of Frontier Posts), which is under the purview of the DOF, has yet to be
completed. The Philippines and the other AMS signed Protocol 2 on 4 May 2018. Although
the ratification of these protocols is a commitment for the Philippines, the
implementation of some of them is not relevant or applicable to the Philippines. The
Department of Transportation has indicated that the National Transit Transport
Coordinating Committee will be reactivated to develop and implement the necessary
domestic procedures for the operationalisation of the ASEAN Framework Agreement of
the Facilitation of Goods in Transit and the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the
Facilitation of Inter-State Transport.

**3.6.** **E-commerce**

The Philippines, like some of its ASEAN neighbours, needs to improve in this sector. The
legal framework for e-identification and authorisation has been established and is
operational at the national level. However, harmonisation at the ASEAN region level is still
being considered.

On revenue collection for cross-border e-commerce, the Philippines maintains threshold
values for customs at a minimum, in line with the provisions of the World Trade
Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement. Various legal frameworks, both in procedural

111

and substantive aspects for business to individual consumers' engagement (B2C), are
already in place (e.g. the Consumer Act of the Philippines, 1992 and the Electronic
Commerce Act, 2000). [11] The E-Commerce Act, particularly Section 50, contemplates the
applicability of the provisions of the Consumer Act, including reliefs and sanctions even
for consumer transactions done electronically.

The Philippines is still working on a mechanism for e-commerce dispute settlement,
including an online dispute resolution system, to facilitate the resolution of claims over ecommerce transactions. It has issued an administrative order on the Rules and
Regulations for Consumer Protection [12] in a transaction covered by the Consumer Act
through electronic means under the E-Commerce Act. This administrative order -- issued
by the DTI, the Department of Health, and the Department of Agriculture (in particular
Section 3) -- specifies the requirements for adopting fair and reasonable business practices
for retailers, sellers, distributors, suppliers, or manufacturers engaged in e-commerce. [13]

**4.** **Conclusion and Key Recommendations**

The Philippines, over the past couple of years (2016--2018), has laid a good foundation for
reform of its trade facilitation environment. The relatively high number of provisions in
category A of the World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement; the enactment
of the CMTA, which is landmark legislation to improve the cargo clearance process; the
strengthened anti-red tape legislation on the ease of doing business; and the upcoming
relaunch of an NSW through the TradeNet platform, all indicate the strong commitment
of the government to facilitate trade.

Data from the questionnaire results showed that the Philippines performed well on
transparency and information, as indicated by the availability of relevant information on
the websites of the BOC and other major government agencies. The enhanced PNTR also
contains the required information under the ATIGA, including private sector-friendly
features (e.g. the tariff finder, rules of origin finder, and NTM finder) using HS codes or
product descriptions. While these features are not mandatory for a national trade
repository, they provide good value addition in the overall effort towards transparency.
Also notable is the relatively strong engagement and communication with the private
sector that is spurred and sustained through the setting up of a mechanism that provides
more opportunities for private sector participation.

The importance of investing more effort in streamlining release and clearance, as well as
import and export formalities, was noted. Also highlighted was the need for the
publication of dwell times and TRSs; advance rulings; and operationalisation of the AEO
programme, including the establishment of mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) for
the AEOs. The proposed TradeNet system to replace the PNSW is very promising but must
be managed carefully to avoid repeating the failures and difficulties of the PNSW.
Strengthening of the institution that manages the PNSW is key to rally other agencies to
support it. Assigning TradeNet to the DOF would ensure strong and important institutional
support.

The suspension of the green lane selectivity system, which puts into question the
application of risk management by the BOC on the shipments entering the country, was
also raised as a serious concern. With the suspension of the green lane, shipments are
now classified as yellow and red, which may also lead to delays in the release of shipments
and, worse, to port congestion. In addition to the suspension of the green lane selectivity
system, the increasing issuance of 'alert orders' -- where alerted shipments are subject to
100% physical inspection -- has also alarmed the private sector. Although the revised CMO
indicated that the 'alerted' shipments would be released within 48 hours, the reality of
constrained inspection areas at the ports could likely delay further inspection and release
of goods from 2 weeks to 1 month.

E-commerce is an important area, but much work still needs to be done -- both at the
national and regional levels.

To improve the trade facilitation environment, the following are specific
recommendations covering the five components.

**Transparency and information on laws, regulations, and procedures**

- Strengthen cooperation amongst agencies through committed information sharing,
i.e. any new information must be published in a timely manner and provided to the
BOC (the primary agency implementing regulations at the border).

- Ensure that links to other agencies' websites, including the PNTR, are updated and
working properly.

- Improve the breadth and quality of information continuously, making it more
business-friendly (user-friendly), e.g. providing a process flow and a checklist of
required documents to guide the users.

- Streamline the regulations, including documentary requirements, especially for
products being regulated by multiple agencies.

**Communication with and active engagement of the private sector**

- Improve active engagement and communication with the private sector,
particularly ensuring formal private sector membership in the NTFC -- more than
just as a mechanism for undertaking consultation with them.

- Study and consult with other agencies to establish a mechanism whereby the NTFC
can provide direction for the consistent application of trade facilitation policies

113

across agreements/FTAs. Review best practices or institutions established by other
countries on the NTFC.

- Operationalise the consultation mechanism of the entire government, strictly
taking into account the agency's Citizen's Charters.

**Release and clearance formalities**

- Study and adopt best practices, especially those implemented by AEOs and Trusted
Traders, which allow early release of goods based on provisional documentation or
incomplete manifests.

- Encourage traders to apply for advance rulings, as this would ensure transparency
and predictability in making decisions with regard to tariff classification, origin, and
valuation, thereby improving the cargo clearance process. Clear and simple
procedures, including online application, could encourage usage of this facility.
Engage private sector associations and chambers so that their members can avail
of the advance rulings facility.

- On risk management, apply inspections based on risk factors and do not inspect
100% of shipments. Consider rationalising the implementation of the 'alert order',
as this mechanism causes delays in the cargo clearance process. Implement the
green lane selectivity system as part of the risk management tool to facilitate trade.

- Study how to improve the application of risk management principles, taking into
account the nature of the agencies and the products being regulated. Risk
management of the BOC and other major agencies could be different.

- Work closely with the Philippine Ports Authority and private terminal operators on
how to institutionalise regular publication of the average dwell time data.

- Work with the Asian Development Bank and other development partners such as
the World Bank, as well as other AMS like Indonesia, to undertake TRSs. Indonesia
has been undertaking regular TRSs and it has experts recognised by the World
Customs Organization.

- Expedite the process for accession to the Istanbul Convention (adoption of the
Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission (ATA) Carnet). Utilise the work
undertaken by the United States Agency for International Development TradeRelated Assistance for Development (TRADE) Project on the ATA Carnet.

**Import/Export formalities**

- Intensify the implementation of the CMTA to improve and facilitate the cargo
clearance process. Complete the drafting of and implement the relevant CAOs and
CMOs.

- Work on the full implementation of the NSW, including clarifying and streamlining
business processes of agencies and 'integrating' other single windows system
(Department of Agriculture system) into one system.

114

- Study and cooperate with other AMS which have successfully integrated their
NSWs with their national trade repositories.

- Automate the cargo clearance process. Consider joint ventures for the
establishment of the ICT system (consider adopting systems of India or the Republic
of Korea). Joint ventures would allow the adoption of new applications at a reduced
cost.

**E-commerce**

- E-commerce focal points and related agencies should coordinate/consult with the
BOC and undertake a study on appropriate mechanisms or alternate models for
collecting duties and taxes for goods covered in e-commerce trade. Work with ecommerce bodies in ASEAN to expedite work for the establishment of a legal
framework and its operationalisation for e-identification and authorisation.
Coordinate with the ASW steering committee and related working groups
(technical working group and legal working group), which may work in similar or
related areas.

##### Chapter 9 Trade Facilitation in Singapore and Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study [1]

_Ponciano Intal Jr., Jonathan Koh, and Edo Setyadi_

**1.** **Introduction**

Singapore is an acknowledged global leader in trade facilitation. Its clearance process by
border agencies, including customs, was ranked first globally on the World Bank's 2016
Logistics Performance Index (LPI), while its overall LPI ranking was fifth. Singapore's
ranking slipped somewhat in the 2018 report to sixth for the customs LPI and seventh on
the overall LPI. However, given the inherent impreciseness of the ratings, it could be
argued that there is virtually no significant difference amongst the front-running
countries, which include Singapore.

Singapore was ranked first on the World Economic Forum's 2016 overall Enabling Trade
Index and on Pillar 3: efficiency and transparency of border administration. On the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Trade Facilitation
Indicators in 2017, Singapore scored the highest value in the majority of the variables. In
the World Economic Forum's 2017 Executive Opinion Survey, it was ranked first on
efficiency in the clearance process. Table 9.1 summarises the result of the Domestic
Logistics Performance Index, based on an online survey of logistics professionals (global
freight forwarders and express carriers) based in Singapore. The survey results show
stand-out evaluations of the efficiency of the customs clearance process (and other
border processes) as well as the quality of infrastructure during 2016--2018. Nonetheless,
the responses indicate the need for improvement in some areas during the same period,
especially on the competence and quality of services. It should be noted that perceptionsbased data such as the LPI have inherent biases. Hence, small changes in percentages may
not mean much. Yet, a substantial gap from the best possible outcome, especially if
persistent, can be indicative of the need for improvement.

Singapore developed the world's first electronic National Single Window (NSW) in the
1980s. The country's excellent achievements in trade facilitation result from its
prioritisation of the issue and a forward-looking, whole-of-government approach.

In view of the global prominence of Singapore in trade facilitation, this chapter focuses
on the historical and institutional developments that have made the country a global
stand-out in this area. It reviews the development of Singapore's NSW, and discusses
innovations in Singapore's customs which may be a model for many of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Member States (AMS). It then examines the ASEAN

**2.** **Development and Characteristics of Singapore's National Single Window**

Many traders use Singapore as a hub for the trans-shipment of goods via vessels and
aircraft. The country provides an ample free trade zone to attract international traders.
Hundreds of multinational corporations and shipping companies do business in Singapore.
Since trade is a significant component of Singapore's economy, the government supports
trade facilitation by providing the most efficient services to the international trading
community, at competitive prices. Singapore's experience in establishing its single
window initiative is a testimony to this.

In 1985, Singapore was hit by a recession. A high-level economic committee convened at
the time identified the improvement of external trade as a major goal, highlighting that
the use of information technology (IT) could make a significant contribution to Singapore's
long-term competitive position. The committee's report was an important mobilising
factor in the realisation of Singapore's single window, implemented in 1989 under the
name of TradeNet. This was the world's first nationwide electronic single window. After
more than 20 years and many upgrades, TradeNet remains the key pillar of Singapore's
trade facilitation efforts and an enabler of its external trade, which totals nearly four times
the gross domestic product.

Singapore's TradeNet has had a tremendous impact on the country's trade facilitation
environment. Before TradeNet, the processing time for permits was up to 2 days and
involved 4--35 documents (UNECE, 2010). After TradeNet, 99% of all permit applications
were processed within 10 minutes electronically. The sharp reduction in the time taken
to process permit applications resulted in about 9.1 million permits being issued per year
from fiscal year (FY) 2013 to FY2017. In addition, the fees charged are one-sixth to one

119

third of the amount charged before TradeNet. Furthermore, TradeNet integrates the
requirements of 35 controlling units. The tremendous success of Singapore's TradeNet
lies in its overall 'single platform and single submission' approach, which has resulted in
streamlined and integrated processing. The extremely fast permit processing of over 9
million trade declarations for more than 12,000 users, involving 32 controlling units, is
due primarily to the integration of all the requirements of the 32 controlling units.

In 2016, a new generation trade information ecosystem was announced. The National
Trade Platform (NTP) seeks to facilitate both business-to-business (B2B) and business-togovernment (B2G) transactions. It puts Singapore's trade facilitation platform on a new
and higher level. Other than migrating existing B2G services, the NTP is designed to be an
innovative platform for new and improved services to enhance traders' efficiency and
competitiveness. The NTP has partnered with banks in Singapore to set up a trade-centric
multi-bank trade finance application portal as well as a trade finance compliance service
to help enhance traders' financing application processes. Other services that enhance
traders' experiences are (i) the Permit Return service, which provides traders with a copy
of their permits; and (ii) the digital Hand-Carried Exports Scheme, which allows exporters
to retrieve proof of clearance digitally. On international connectivity, the NTP allows for
the electronic submission and exchange of a Preferential Certificate of Origin between
Singapore and China, as well as online applications for and transmission of an electronic
Certificate of Non-Manipulation to China. The NTP brings certainty through the
authenticity of the Preferential Certificate of Origin and Certificate of Non-Manipulation,
and reduces the business costs associated with handling and transportation of paper
documentation.

Underpinning the innovations in the NTP is the aim to make Singapore the world's leading
trade, supply chain, and trade financing hub. Indeed, as Singapore is facing stiffer
competition from other ports in the region, it is precisely an integrated trade, supply
chain, and trade finance ecosystem that gives Singapore a continued edge over other
ports in the region as a global and regional trans-shipment hub.

**3.** **Customs, Trade Facilitation, Risk Management, and the Whole-of-Government**
**Approach**

'Unlike most customs authorities in the world, [Singapore Customs'] primary mission is

in trade facilitation' **(** Singapore Customs, 2010: 4).

Trade is the lifeblood of Singapore, and as such, the mindset of Singapore Customs is to
'regulate trade [in order to] enable trade to flow quickly and smoothly in, out and through
Singapore' (Singapore Customs, 2010: 12). To some extent, this makes Singapore an
unrealistic reference point for a number of AMS with much larger populations, domestic
markets, and industries than Singapore. Nonetheless, the Singapore experience provides
some insights for regulating trade so that it flows as quickly and smoothly as possible and
can become a strong pillar for development in any AMS. The three major insights are the
following: (i) balancing trade control and trade facilitation with effective risk

120

management; (ii) a whole-of-government approach to both trade control and trade
facilitation, and (iii) customs as forward-looking and a driver of partnerships.

**3.1.** **Merging Trade Control and Facilitation with Risk Management** [2 ]

Rather than seeing them as opposites, Singapore Customs regards trade regulation and
trade facilitation as two sides of the same coin -- contrasting roles that are essential for
each other. To achieve both objectives without compromising either one is a challenge,
given Singapore's large trade volume. For Singapore Customs, this is where risk
management is key.

Singapore Customs plays the role of the trade highway police. As the regulator of trade,
its main purpose is not to slow down trade flows, or even to penalise errant traders, but
to facilitate smooth-flowing trade traffic and peaceful journeys for law-abiding traders. As
such, facilitation and control are vital to each other.

But even the most vigilant highway police cannot keep an eye on every vehicle on the
road -- Singapore alone handles one-fifth of the world's total container trans-shipment
throughput. Hence, to facilitate trade and protect revenue while securing Singapore's
status as a trusted global trade hub, risk-based rules and procedures are used to govern
its trade highway.

Under Singapore Customs' risk assessment system, traders' compliance records and
willingness to cooperate are taken into consideration. Those showing a poor history of
compliance are subject to more frequent interventions while the rest are not
inconvenienced unnecessarily.

Risk management is a rigorous process whereby the control measures are constantly
reviewed. Emerging risks that are detected in the operating environment are assessed,
then appropriate adjustments are made or new control measures are incorporated to
reduce risk exposures without hampering the flow of legitimate trade. Control measures
are also in place to detect and deal with offences early so that the impact on trade is
minimised.

The application of risk management to achieve both facilitation and control can be
observed at various stages of the trade permit approval and goods clearance process. For
every import consignment, a trade declaration must be submitted and approved
electronically by Singapore Customs before it is allowed to clear the customs checkpoint.

**3.2.** **Trade Facilitation and Integrated Risk-Based System** [3 ]

Launched on 26 January 2011, the Trade Facilitation and Integrated Risk-Based System
(TradeFIRST) is Singapore Customs' initiative for improving trade facilitation through
better partnership with businesses. A single holistic framework that integrates facilitation,
compliance, and risk management, TradeFIRST promises to make trade easier, fairer, and
more secure. Finding a flexible and responsive approach that serves business needs has

2 This section draws heavily from Singapore Customs (2011a).

121

been key for Singapore Customs to balance its twin roles of facilitating trade and ensuring
the integrity of the trading system.

Recognising the increasing challenges faced by businesses and traders, such as the
growing complexities and interdependencies of supply chains, Singapore Customs sought
to strengthen and enhance the relationship between customs and the trading community
even further. Reviewing existing transactions and relationships with businesses and
traders, Singapore Customs found that despite the many facilitation schemes available in
the existing system, companies were not always aware of them. A new approach was
proposed -- one that would transform the way customs facilitates and regulates trade.

TradeFIRST is a comprehensive assessment framework that integrates elements of
facilitation, compliance, and risk management. A one-stop service, TradeFIRST enables
Singapore Customs to engage with traders more proactively and facilitate business
operations in a way that is systematic, risk-based, and consistent -- thus supporting
Singapore Customs' motto of making trade easy, fair, and secure.

_**Whole-of-Government Approach**_ _[4]_

Singapore's early experience in developing its NSW -- TradeNet -- provided it with the
insight that coordinated border management is fundamental to developing and sustaining
an effectual trade facilitation environment.

Both the NSW and the coordinated border management mindset are complementary
elements of Singapore's whole-of-government approach to providing efficient trade
facilitation to the trading community. Using TradeNet, the trading community is able to
submit permit applications electronically for processing, via a single point of entry to
government agencies. All major agencies (known as Competent Authorities in Singapore)
involved in regulating trade flows are part of TradeNet. The major realignments needed
to support Singapore's NSW implementation were achieved through extensive
discussions and consensus building with government agencies, companies, organisations,
and industry associations. This focus on achieving a win--win outcome enabled all parties
involved to overcome the initial difficulties, as they saw the potential savings and benefits
from reducing the burden associated with handling trade documentation.

The journey to achieving a whole-of-government approach for trade regulatory issues did
not start overnight. The business process re-engineering undertaken as part of
Singapore's TradeNet implementation in 1989 provided a strong foundation for the then
Customs and Excise Department, and partner government agencies involved in trade
regulatory issues. This foundation was followed by further consolidation, continual
improvements, and increased coordination over the years.

One of the most noteworthy developments took place in 2003, when the government
recognised the need for greater synergy, and for a reorganisation of the trade and border

3  This section draws from Singapore Customs and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore
(2015).

122

authorities in Singapore. This resulted in the formation of the Immigration & Checkpoints
Authority (ICA) of Singapore as the single agency for checkpoints and border control
functions, while Singapore Customs was established as the single contact point for all
customs, revenue, and trade matters. Whereas the former Customs and Excise
Department was mainly focused on revenue matters, the new Singapore Customs is
vested with responsibility for both revenue and trade facilitation matters. This working
arrangement allows the ICA and Singapore Customs to share the responsibility of securing
Singapore's borders, and yet be effective in facilitating legitimate trade.

_**Improved Detection through Collaboration**_

Data are essential in the modern border regulatory environment. Effective risk
management is heavily dependent on the availability of data, as well as the ability to
integrate the available data so as to inform selectivity and tactical decision-making.

Through TradeNet, all agencies with border regulatory functions are able to process their
respective regulatory requirements through an integrated single window interface. In this
way, regulatory agencies can focus on their respective control areas, while the system
provides the functionalities to route declarations to the relevant agencies and provide
approval responses to trade.

However, the challenges of the modern trading environment require a higher level of
sophistication. Agencies must not only focus on their respective control areas, but also
recognise cross-cutting risks, and ensure coordination between different government
stakeholders. The security and integrity of the trading system is not merely the job of one
agency but affects the entire country.

With this in mind, Singapore Customs works closely with the ICA, using a risk-based
approach, to identify shipments posing security risks and take steps to mitigate such risks
through actions on the ground. The two agencies cooperate on joint risk profiling and
targeting efforts, rendering operational assistance to each other when suspicious
shipments are detected. Singapore Customs and the ICA consult with each other on
decisions to inspect or interdict shipments when necessary.

Singapore's small physical size and labour constraints means that no single agency is able
to discharge all of its regulatory responsibilities in a self-contained way. Agencies, by
virtue of their specialisations, will best know the risks that affect the commodities under
their control. Even though Singapore Customs and the ICA may have broad powers under
the law to act on behalf of partner government agencies, both Singapore Customs and
the ICA recognise that such authority needs to be exercised in collaboration with those
partner agencies so that their specific knowledge of their domain can be brought to bear,
for maximum success rates in detection and enforcement.

In this way, larger agencies, such as Singapore Customs and the ICA, which have stronger
enforcement competencies and experience of cross-border regulatory offences, can
provide support to other agencies for undertaking seizures and carrying out enforcement
on suspicious shipments detected. Consequently, all agencies work together to achieve

123

the synergies necessary to meet their respective regulatory mandates, and contribute to
the prosperity and security of the country.

_**Forward-Looking and Driver of Partnerships**_

Given that Singapore is highly dependent on trade and is a global trade hub, Singapore
Customs has to be able to meet the challenges of the fast-evolving global business
environment, especially the growing complexity of global supply chains, the growth of ecommerce, and the rising threat of terrorism, as well as concerns regarding the safety of
international cargoes and the prevention of shipping as a tool for terrorism and crime.
Towards this end, Singapore Customs has been forward-looking and a key driver of
partnerships with a whole-of-government mindset.

Singapore Customs was a key player in the development and enhancement of TradeNet
even though the Trade Development Board was the lead agency until April 2003 when
Singapore Customs took over. Singapore Customs made TradeNet completely web-based
in 2007 with version 4.0, established TradeXchange in 2007 to connect traders to the
commercial systems of other countries, and started operationalising the NTP by 2017.
Guided by its view that trade facilitation, compliance, and security are complementary, in
2007 Singapore Customs launched the Secure Trade Partnership, which is Singapore's
national Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) programme as well as the national supply
chain security programme. Singapore Customs has been engaged in discussions with
other countries on the mutual recognition of supply chain security programmes.
Singapore chaired the World Customs Organization working group to develop trade
recovery guidelines to bring back trade to normalcy after disruptions to international
trade flows after the 2007 Global Financial Crisis (see, for example, Singapore Customs
(2010)). To ensure Singapore's continuing role as a global trade and logistics hub,
Singapore has to anticipate evolving business and technological trends and as such needs
to be forward-looking.

Singapore Customs also had to be a driver of partnerships, not only with the private sector
(as its main clients) but also with other domestic and international agencies and
governments, both in the region and globally. The discussion earlier in the report brings
out the whole-of-government perspective to trade facilitation, control, and security. As
supply chains are global and increasingly more complex, Singapore is strengthening
partnerships beyond its borders towards more efficient end-to-end supply chain
facilitation and security of international trade.

**4.** **The ASTFI Baseline Results**

**4.1.** **Highlights and Key Findings of the ASTFI Scores**

The questionnaire surveys on the ASTFI were conducted with 16 government agencies,
including Singapore Customs and major agencies identified by the Singapore government.
They consisted of seven components: (i) transparency and information on laws,
regulations, and procedures; (ii) communication with and active engagement of the

124

private sector; (iii) release and clearance formalities; (iv) import/export formalities; (v)
cross-border coordination and transit facilitation; (vi) transport facilitation; and (vii) ecommerce. The results of the survey are summarised below.

**4.2.** **Transparency and Information on Laws, Regulations, and Procedures**

Singapore has a high level of transparency with regards to customs-related information.
Singapore's customs and major controlling agencies have websites with all the necessary
information pertaining to each agency. Customs has a call centre. Information on
Singapore's non-tariff measures (NTM) is available in the ASEAN Trade Repository (ATR)
but is not commodity-specific.

**4.3.** **Communication with and Active Engagement of the Private Sector**

Singapore has a good record of government agencies, including customs, applying a clientcentric philosophy. Government agencies consult with the private sector on new
regulations and publish the draft regulations on both the agency websites and a
centralised website for all new regulations in order to obtain feedback from concerned
stakeholders and other interested parties. For example, private sector stakeholders were
heavily consulted for major initiatives such as Singapore Customs' TradeFIRST. Moreover,
the agencies provide public information on the likely impact of the proposed regulation(s)
on the government, the private sector, and international commitments, amongst others.
Thus, there is significant private sector involvement in new regulations as a matter of
government practice. However, there is no institutionalised (not ad hoc) private sector
membership of the National Trade Facilitation Committee.

**4.4.** **Release and Clearance Formalities**

Pre-arrival processing, an appeal and review mechanism, separation of release from final
determination, and payment of customs duties and temporary admission are available
and applied by Singapore Customs. Pre-arrival processing is available at the main port and
other sea terminals; airports (Changi Airport and Airport Logistics Park); and on land (land
borders with Malaysia). Singapore Customs also has various schemes available to suspend
the payment of duties and goods and services taxes without guarantee (as well as with
guarantee). Temporary admission is being implemented using the Admission
Temporaire/Temporary Admission (ATA) Convention.

However, Singapore does not publish reports on dwell time and Time Release Studies. In
terms of self-certification, since it is an ASEAN regional initiative, it is still in the pilot stage.
Advance Rulings by customs are not fully published, as they are subject to the consent of
the trader who/which asked for the ruling.

For best practice risk management, Singapore implemented an integrated risk
management system under TradeFIRST. Launched in January 2011, TradeFIRST is a single
holistic framework that integrates facilitation, compliance, and risk management to make
trade easier, fairer, and more secure, in the context of the growing complexities and
interdependence of supply chains.

125

Singapore Customs maintains an AEO programme as well as mutual recognition
arrangements (MRAs) with a number of non-AMS administrations such as Australia,
Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and the United States.
Singapore also signed an AEO MRA with Thailand on 4 July 2018 -- the first AEO MRA
between two AMS.

**4.5.** **Import/Export Formalities and Coordination**

Singapore is excellent in customs and import/export processes, i.e. under the release and
clearance formalities and import/export formalities. There is more work to be done on
regional initiatives such as the ASEAN Single Window.

The discussion in the previous sections on the evolution of Singapore's NSW suggests that
the essence of the more recent innovations in TradeFIRST and the NTP could be models
for other AMS, albeit with some adaptation because of the unique circumstances of
Singapore and the specificities of each AMS.

**4.6.** **Cross-Border Coordination and Transit Facilitation**

Institutional coordination with bordering and neighbouring countries appears to be
limited. This is probably because both Singapore and Malaysia have relatively efficient
processes on both sides of the land border such that there is no strong demand from
stakeholders for institutional coordination arrangements (e.g. Singapore has pre-arrival
processing on its land border with Malaysia). Nonetheless, there are a number of
coordination platforms for cross-border transport issues with Malaysia, such as the
Transportation Links Working Group.

The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority indicated that there is no coordination
mechanism at the institutional or operational level with Malaysia, Singapore's only
bordering country by land. However, the ASEAN Customs Transit System (ACTS), which
has been pilot tested amongst Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, involves significant
operational cooperation amongst the three countries for both goods and transport. The
computerised transit system that Singapore Customs pilot tested in 2016 and 2017 has
no transit guarantee mechanism in place. There are simplified procedures for Authorised
Transit Traders, as determined by the contracting powers.

**4.7.** **Transport Facilitation**

Procedures for the issuance of ASEAN Goods Vehicle Cross-Border Permits are under
development. The permits will be subject to technical requirements for the vehicles. The
port community system is operational in the main port, but not yet linked to other AMS.

Singapore has ratified Protocols 1 (designation of transit transport routes facilities) and 4
(technical requirement of vehicles) of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the
Facilitation of Goods in Transit (AFAFGIT), and national laws and regulations are in place,
but there is no implementation structure or system as yet. As of 2018, Protocol 2 had not
yet been ratified, which means it is not yet operational. This also applies to the ASEAN
Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Inter-State Transport (AFAFIST) and ASEAN
Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT) -- there is no ratification for

126

either of these ASEAN framework agreements by Singapore until 2018, but the Singapore
Logistics Association has a registry of multimodal transport operators.

**4.8.** **E-commerce**

A legal framework for e-identification and authorisation has been established and is
operational at the national level. However, harmonisation at the ASEAN level is still being
considered. Singapore has a de minimis value, in line with the World Trade Organization
Trade Facilitation Agreement, and is conducting a study on revenue collection frameworks
on e-commerce trade. It is still working on a mechanism for e-commerce dispute
settlement and a revenue collection framework for cross-border e-commerce trade, while
collaborating with ASEAN on regional framework agreements.

**5.** **Concluding Remarks and the Way Forward**

Singapore is a global pioneer and an acknowledged stand-out in trade facilitation, with a
customs administration whose primary focus is trade facilitation -- unlike most customs
authorities in the world. With the major exception of the information on NTMs, most of
the slow progress areas are related to ASEAN initiatives or cross-border ASEAN
facilitation.

Moving forward, apart from improving the country's NTM database accessibility, the key
recommendation is related to Singapore's role as a catalyst and learning leader in ASEAN
on trade facilitation, in light of the innovations and trade facilitation experience of
Singapore Customs. Singapore's chairing of the ASEAN Customs Procedures and Trade
Facilitation Working Group, ASEAN Single Window Steering Committee, Sub-Working
Group on ASEAN AEO-MRA, and ASEAN Customs Transit System provides a platform to
accelerate trade facilitation initiatives in ASEAN moving forward.

In addition, Singapore can support further ASEAN initiatives by ratifying and implementing
ASEAN transport facilitation protocols and agreements as needed. After all, a wellperforming ASEAN trade facilitation regime will benefit the country given its importance
in value chains, logistics, and trade finance in the region and indeed the world.

**1.** **Trade Overview**

Thailand is one of the most open economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN). The total volume of trade to gross domestic product (GDP) was 121% in 2018,
down from its peak of 140% in 2008 (World Bank, n.d.). Thailand's 10 most important
trading partners are China, Japan, the United States, Malaysia, Viet Nam, Indonesia,
Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, and the Republic of Korea (henceforth, Korea) --
comprising 61% of the total trade value. Amongst them, China is the biggest trading
partner with 16% in trade value, followed by Japan and the United States, at 12% and 9%,
respectively. Amongst the ASEAN countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Viet Nam
are the biggest trading partners, with a combined trade value of 16% of Thailand's total
trade value (Ministry of Commerce, n.d.).

Table 10.1 summarises the main export and import products from and to Thailand. In
terms of exports, motor vehicles, accessories, and components are the main exporting
products, comprising 11% of total exports in 2018, reflecting the important and steady
growth of the industrial sector. The 10 most important import products of Thailand shared
62% of the import value. Crude oil still ranked first for a long time, followed by machinery
and electric machinery. Consequently, considerable evidence shows that Thailand needs
to import machinery and significant materials from other countries.

**2.** **Secondary Indicators of the Trading Environment**

From 2006 to 2015, there were significant improvements in the trade facilitation
environment in Thailand, as shown by a 47% reduction in the cost to export and a 45%
reduction in the cost to import. The improvement in cost was complemented by a shorter
time to export, from 24 days to 14 days, while the time to import was shortened from 22
days to 13 days (Table 10.2).

Thailand has maintained a good trade facilitation environment, as measured by the
Domestic Logistics Performance Index (LPI) indicators (Table 10.3). Based on a survey, [2]
100% of respondents in 2016 answered that every aspect of Thailand's logistics
environment had improved since 2013 (customs clearance procedures, other official
clearance procedures, trade and transport infrastructure, telecommunication and

information technology infrastructure, private logistics services, regulations related to
logistics, and solicitation of informal payments).

The domestic LPI survey also indicates that none (0%) of the respondents perceived the
trade and transport related infrastructure (ports, airports, roads, warehousing,
telecommunications, and information technology) to be low quality. Improvement is
needed, however, in the area of competence and quality services delivered by logistics
service providers in road and rail because 0% of respondents perceived them to be of high
quality.

**3.** **Customs Clearance Process**

The following is a brief description of the customs clearance process in Thailand when
importing or exporting goods, highlighting the use of e-import and e-export procedures.

When a shipment arrives in Thailand, importers are required to submit a goods
declaration together with supporting documents for the imports, if needed, to a customs
officer at the port of entry. In addition, some goods may require permits from the relevant
permit issuing agencies, depending on the value and nature of the imports.

The necessary documents include (i) an import declaration; (ii) a bill of lading or air
waybill; (iii) an invoice; (iv) a packing list; (v) an import licence (if applicable); (vi)
certificates of origin (if applicable); and (vii) other relevant documents, e.g. catalogues
and product ingredients.

131

**3.1.** **Customs E-Import Procedure**

Under the e-import system (Thai Customs, 2017b), relevant parties do not need to submit
paper documents, as all data are transmitted electronically to the e-customs system.
Generally, the declaration and clearance process undergoes four stages:

1. **Submission of declaration** . Shipping agents submit a ship or aircraft arrival report,
along with manifest information, electronically to the e-customs system.

2. **Verification of the declaration** . The e-customs system verifies the data in the first
stage and issues a declaration and payment numbers within a few seconds. At this
stage, the goods declaration is classified into green or red lanes based on the risk
management system.

3. **Payment of import duties and taxes** . The importer or customs broker makes the
payment either at the Thai Customs Department, through banks, or via the epayment system.

4. **Inspection and release of cargo** . Officials inspect and finally release the cargo from
customs custody.

**3.2.** **Customs E-Export Procedure**

Goods intended to be exported from Thailand are subject to normal export procedures
(Thai Customs, 2017a). For customs purposes, an export is the removal of goods by ship
or aircraft from a place in Thailand to a place outside Thailand. All goods being exported
from Thailand are subject to control by the Thai Customs Department (TCD) and must be
reported to the TCD.

The TCD's role in the exportation of goods is to ensure that all goods being exported from
Thailand are reported as required; and to administer controls on behalf of permit-issuing
agencies on the export of restricted goods. In addition, customs gathers information
regarding the nature and volume of exports to assist the government and industry in
policy and decision-making.

Unless specifically exempt, goods may not be loaded on a ship or aircraft for export unless
they have been entered for export in the customs system and customs has given approval
to export. Most applications for an export declaration are submitted electronically via the
e-export system.

The documents required to be submitted to customs for the clearance of exports
comprise (i) an export declaration; (ii) an invoice; (iii) an export licence (if applicable); and
(iv) other relevant documents, e.g. catalogues and product ingredients.

Once the export declaration data have been entered into the customs computer system,
they undergo automatic processing (e.g. data validation, data matching, and release
status) and the cargo is released. Similar to the e-import procedure, the e-export
clearance processes generally include four stages:

132

(i) **Submission of declaration** . The exporter/broker submits an export declaration in
an ebXML message to the e-customs system.

(ii) **Verification of declaration** . As soon as the e-customs system receives and validates
the export declaration data, the goods declaration number and payment number
are generated. Then, the response message is transmitted to the exporter/broker.

(iii) **Payment of duties and taxes** . Payments are available either at the TCD, through
banks, or via the e-payment system.

(iv) **Inspection and release of cargo** . The freight forwarder loads cargo into containers
and electronically sends a cargo control report to the e-customs system. The ecustoms system validates the data and reports any errors for immediate online
correction. If no error is found, the cargo control report number is automatically
generated by the system and the response message is sent to the freight forwarder
and the exporter/broker.

**4.** **Results from the ASTFI Survey**

Based on the information received from the ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators
(ASTFI) survey, the validation-cum-consultation workshop and meetings held with select
agencies, as well as secondary research, have shown that Thailand is one the most
advanced in the area of trade facilitation amongst the ASEAN Member States (AMS).
Various agencies responded to the survey in March 2018 and participated in the
validation-cum-consultation workshop and meetings held in June 2018. Some 22 major
government agencies identified by Thailand, including the TCD, responded to the ASTFI
questionnaires on seven components: (i) transparency and information on laws,
regulations, and procedures; (ii) communication with and active engagement of the
private sector; (iii) release and clearance formalities; (iv) import/export formalities; (v)
cross-border coordination and transit facilitation; (vi) transport facilitation; and (vii) ecommerce.

**4.1.** **Transparency and Information on Laws, Regulations, and Procedures**

Thailand has implemented this component quite impressively. The TCD and the National
Trade Repository (NTR) websites are generally well developed and user-friendly. [3] They
contain all the relevant information, but some of the information (e.g. transit procedures
and customs procedures for trans-shipments) is only available in the local language. Those
regulations that are still in the Thai language should be translated to English to better
serve not only the Thai speaking stakeholders but all the stakeholders. An easy-to-follow
process flow is available, and the required documents are identified. Interactive
information channels are available on the customs website, with an operational help desk
to respond to the needs of stakeholders.

[http://www.thailandntr.com/en (accessed 25 June 2018).](http://www.thailandntr.com/en)

133

Consistent with its survey results, Thailand's efforts to improve transparency and
engagement with the private sector have led them to explore alternative and innovative
ways of engaging the private sector. As part of its projects and strategies under Customs
4.0, [4] the Customs Alliances programme was introduced to provide additional
collaboration between the TCD and the private sector through the Account Officer Center.

**4.2.** **Communication with and Active Engagement of the Private Sector**

For this component, Thailand has performed quite impressively. The National Trade
Facilitation Committee (NTFC) under the Ministry of Commerce is functionally strong and
active in its engagement with the private sector. The government's strong commitment
to trade facilitation is again manifested by the leadership of the NTFC, which is chaired by
the Deputy Prime Minister with the Minister of Commerce as vice-chair. The NTFC has a
subcommittee which is chaired by the permanent secretary or deputy permanent
secretary of the Ministry of Commerce, with the directors general of relevant agencies as
members.

The NTFC has the authority to manage and supervise agencies in Thailand to fulfil the
trade facilitation commitments of the World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation
Agreement (WTO-TFA), the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), and other trade
facilitation related agreements in the future. Strong private sector participation in the
NTFC is very important, as it should also be able to provide guidance/direction for the
implementation of policies on trade facilitation across free trade agreements and other
relevant agreements with trade facilitation commitments.

Formal structures for stakeholder consultations -- including those catering to micro, small,
and medium-sized enterprises -- are available at the TCD as well as other major agencies.
An important note to mention is the requirement in Article 77 of New Thailand's
Constitution that requires government agencies to conduct a public consultation when
they want to introduce new regulations.

**4.3.** **Release and Clearance Formalities**

Despite its impressive performance, there is plenty of room for improvement in this
component. For example, the dwell time report is not published and the Time Release
Study report is only published on an ad hoc basis and so far has been conducted only in
one port. The non-implementation of the self-certification scheme on rules of origin in
ASEAN has also placed Thailand in a pilot stage similar to the other AMS.

The TCD carries out risk management, where the inspection is based on risk factors. The
application of risk management by the TCD is consistent with its rules and regulations to
ensure compliance with international best practices in risk management. For alerted
goods, the TCD usually conducts several processes before undertaking physical inspection

4 Customs 4.0 came from Thai national policy -- Thailand 4.0, which is an economic model that aims to
unlock the country from several economic challenges resulting from past economic development models
which place emphasis on agriculture (Thailand 1.0), light industry (Thailand 2.0), and advanced industry
(Thailand 3.0). These challenges include 'a middle income trap', 'an inequality trap', and 'an imbalanced
trap'. For more information: http://thaiembdc.org/thailand-4-0-2/

134

(e.g. document checks) and non-intrusive inspections (e.g. x-ray). As part of the practice,
and stipulated in the old regulation, the inspection is expected to be finished within the
day (office hours). Although the new guidelines do not explicitly indicate the deadline for
completing the inspection, they require officers to perform the inspections immediately
after the letter for inspection is sent out.

Electronic payments are accepted by the TCD and some agencies, with others working to
develop e-payment facilities. The use of electronic payments is important, especially at
airports or border crossings, to facilitate payment and ensure that all relevant duties are
collected.

The TCD allows the release of goods with a full declaration of entry and the submission of
documents and manifest. At the moment, Thailand has pre-arrival processing only for air
and sea, but not for land -- even though it shares land borders with certain countries.
There seems to be no urgent need for pre-arrival processing for land. Even if there is prearrival processing, vehicles still queue at the border due to the limited infrastructure
facilities.

Advance Rulings for valuation and classification, the appeal and review mechanism, and
post-clearance audit; and trade facilitation measures for Trusted Traders or Authorised
Economic Operators (AEOs) are available and implemented by the TCD.

The TCD provides an advance ruling on tariff classification, customs valuation, and rules
of origin. An advance ruling can be issued 30 working days after the receipt of the
application, and an importer should submit the application prior to importation. An
Advance Ruling request can be submitted online. Through a mobile app, an applicant can
keep track of the results of the Advance Rulings application, including appeals, and the
TCD informs the applicant of the application for the issuance of Advance Rulings.

An applicant can request an Advance Ruling at responsible bureaus or offices. For Advance
Rulings on tariff classification and rules of origin, the responsible bureau is the Customs
Tariff Bureau, while for Advance Rulings on customs valuation, the responsible bureau is
the Customs Standard Procedure and Valuation Bureau. The results of Advance Rulings
are valid for 2 years after the date of issuance. If the person who requests an Advance
Ruling is not satisfied with the advice, he/she may request a review within 15 days after
the issuance of such Advance Ruling. About 1,400 Advance Ruling requests are made
annually for tariff ruling applications, while few requests or applications are received for
Advance Rulings on valuation and rules of origin. Advance Rulings issued are published for
transparency and to serve as reference for the public prior to requesting advance rulings
on issues that have already been adjudicated.

To ensure security in the supply chain, Thailand has established the AEO programme,
under which it provides incentives and benefits to trusted operators. The establishment
of AEOs would be more effective if mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) were put in
place. Although AMS have established MRAs with other countries, currently only Thailand
and Singapore have established MRAs with each other amongst the AMS. Like other AMS,
Thailand has also established MRAs with Hong Kong and Korea.

135

It is also worth noting that Thailand has instituted a Voluntary Audit Programme that
allows traders to submit themselves to audit voluntarily, which could reduce the cost of
liability, if any.

Thailand is also one of the few countries in ASEAN that has acceded to the Istanbul
Convention, which allows the temporary admission of goods without payment of duties
or taxes. Temporary admission is an important aspect of the customs procedures and
processes, as it impacts the area of trade facilitation and helps countries that are
experiencing calamities. Heavy equipment used to build structures such as bridges can be
allowed to enter the territory temporarily without the payment of duties or taxes, and
the equipment can be pulled out later.

**4.4.** **Import/Export Formalities and Coordination**

The TCD indicated that traders/clients are not allowed to attach digital copies when filing
entry declarations due to limitations in the customs system. In addition to the system
limitation, a TCD notification [5] prohibits the acceptance of digital copies. The TCD has,
however, indicated that it will be developing a system that would allow the acceptance of
digital copies.

Almost all Thai government agencies are linked to the National Single Window (NSW)
either by using their own system or going through the NSW web portal. [6] Thailand's NSW
is one of the more advanced single window systems in ASEAN. An important aspect of
Thailand's success in its NSW is the whole-of-government approach and having strong
institutional support in the TCD. More than 30 government agencies are connected to the
Thai NSW. Thailand is also one of five AMS that are part of the live implementation of the
e-ATIGA Certificate of Origin Form D exchange under the ASEAN Single Window (ASW). At
the moment, Thailand is looking at how the NSW will be integrated to its NTR.

**4.5.** **Cross-Border Coordination and Transit Facilitation**

Despite the fully functional computerised system for transit, the border-crossing
operational coordination with neighbouring countries, transit guarantee mechanism, and
simplified procedures for Authorised Transit Traders remain limited. A paper-based
transit guarantee mechanism is in place, but the implementation of the ASEAN Customs
Transit System would be particularly helpful in the establishment of this guarantee
mechanism.

To improve the indicators of this component, region-wide implementation of ASEAN
protocols such as the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit
(AFAFGIT) would be beneficial. Thailand's new Customs Act, 2017 provides that transit
goods shall operate under international agreement. Thailand is working to hasten the
ratification process of the AFAFGIT, together with bilateral memoranda of understanding

5 Customs Department Notification No. 25/BE2557 (2014) on Registration as a Customs Clearance or
Conduct of a Customs Procedure.

136

with neighbouring countries, while using temporary internal measures to allow goods in
transit operation.

**4.6.** **Transport Facilitation**

Thailand needs to improve its transport facilitation due to the lack of operationalisation
of protocols under the AFAFGIT and the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Facilitation of
Inter-State. Transport (AFAFIST). Likewise, with respect to the operationalisation of the
AFAFIST and the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT), only
the AFAMT has been operationalised. However, national laws and regulations, including
the implementation structure and system, are in place.

Although there is an electronic data interchange in the main port, no port community
system (PCS) is being operated. Laem Chabang could be considered a PCS, but available
information could not confirm its status as a PCS.

**4.7.** **E-commerce**

Thailand's implementation of e-commerce is relatively high compared with most AMS.
Thailand has an established legal framework for interoperable, mutually recognised,
secure, reliable, and user-friendly e-identification and authorisation. It has implemented
the national e-legal transaction acts, while legislation on authorisation and security is
being developed. Amongst those enactments are the Electronic Transaction Act (2001),
and its amended version in 2008, including secondary legislation to exemplify selected
methods of e-transactions (2006), monitoring of e-transactions (2008), and the safety of
e-transactions (2010).

Related bills that are in the process of development include the personal information act,
whose draft has been approved in principle by the cabinet and is being reviewed by the
Council of State before resubmission to the cabinet and subsequently to the National
Assembly for final approval. Meanwhile, the bill on cybersecurity is being drafted.

Thailand's current regime waives both customs duties and value-added tax (VAT) for any
goods valued within ฿1,500 ( _de minimis_ value) that are delivered across borders to
Thailand. For electronic transmissions, Thailand follows the World Trade Organization
Moratorium on Customs Duties on Electronic Transmissions. However, a study is ongoing
in the Ministry of Finance on ways to collect internal tax or VAT on goods delivered across
borders to create a level playing field for e-commerce for both domestic and foreign
business entities.

Thailand provides protection for consumers using e-commerce at a similar level of
protection to that provided for consumers of other forms of commerce. Consumer
protection-related legislation is already in place, e.g. Consumer Protection Act, B.E. 2522
(1979) and Product Liability Act, B.E. 2551 (2008).

On cross-border e-commerce dispute settlement, the Thailand Arbitration Center has
conducted a study on developing an online dispute resolution mechanism. The pilot
system, called TalkDD, has been developed and will soon be pilot tested. There is a

137

bilateral memorandum of understanding between Thailand and Korea on the legal
framework for domestic and cross-border e-commerce dispute settlement.

**5.** **Key Recommendations**

Overall, Thailand has done quite well in improving its trade facilitation environment.
Based on the survey results and the information from secondary sources such as the
World Bank's Ease of Doing Business trading across borders indicators and the Logistics
Performance Index, Thailand also did well. There are, however, some specific
recommendations that would help address or improve the specific components.

**5.1.** **Transparency and Information on Laws, Regulations, and Procedures**

Thailand has made most of the relevant information under this component available on
the websites of customs, major agencies, and the NTR. But transparency requires allowing
better access to information by all stakeholders. The translation of some of Thailand's
customs laws and regulations to English, e.g. transit and trans-shipment information,
would provide better access for other stakeholders. In case of difficulty in the English
translation, an initial step could be a brief explanation in English and even a flow chart or
business process in English on the procedures and requirements would help a lot.

Information on the goods being regulated should also be available, especially if certain
goods/products are regulated by multiple agencies. Having the information available will
also provide the opportunity and a good reference for the multiple agencies involved in
regulating certain products to streamline procedures and documentary requirements.
Continuous 'populating' and updating of the NTR -- especially non-tariff measures, which
are increasing in number -- should be a priority. The Economic Research Institute for
ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA)--United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) NTM database [7] would be a good resource for this process of updating the
NTMs section of the NTR

The interactive channels should be tested or checked constantly to ensure that they are
available/accessible.

**5.2.** **Communication with and Active Engagement of the Private Sector**

Although Thailand has a functional NTFC, private sector membership of the committee,
including its working group, should be ensured. Enhancing and developing the NTFC as a
clearing house would ensure consistent application or implementation of trade
facilitation reforms across agreements/international commitments, and perhaps set the
policy direction on trade facilitation matters.

A regular consultation mechanism for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises should
be established/enhanced, leveraging existing groupings or associations.

(accessed 10 June 2018).

138

**5.3.** **Release and Clearance Formalities**

The implementation of the Customs Intelligence Center would be very helpful for Thailand
in building its risk management capacity. There may be a need to clarify what type of risk
management is applicable for customs and major agencies, including its implementation,
to ensure appropriate interventions. Risk management application depends on the goods
covered, agencies involved, and parameters set. Subsequent ASTFI questionnaires should
take this even deeper to capture and better understand the appropriateness of the
application of risk management for customs and major agencies.

The challenges of establishing an e-payment mechanism/infrastructure should be
assessed. The set-up may require coordination and consultation with other agencies, e.g.
the Ministry of Finance and the Treasury Department, as well as private e-payment
facilities. The government is losing revenue because of lack of e-payment facilities, e.g.
credit cards at airports for dutiable goods.

Customs should work closely with port authorities and terminal operators on the
publication of average dwell times. It should coordinate/work with the Asian
Development Bank and other AMS (e.g. Indonesia) to undertake Time Release Studies. It
should also share experiences and practices with other AMS, e.g. Indonesia and Malaysia.

Implementing expedited shipments for land cargo has been challenging. Long queues at
land borders cannot be addressed by simplified procedures alone, but infrastructure
requirements could be examined to address such queues.

Thailand should work with other AMS for the immediate implementation of the ASEANwide self-certification system on rules of origin, and eventually the use of e-selfcertification through the ASW system.

**5.4.** **Import/Export Formalities**

Thailand is working to address the restriction of attaching supporting documents to entry
declarations. An effective NSW/ASW could make this concern moot, as documents could
be submitted through the NSW/ASW. If this is a system-related issue, it could easily be
addressed, but if the implementation is related to government policy, this should be
carefully discussed and eventually addressed to facilitate its eventual implementation.

Continuous streamlining of business processes, including documentary requirements, is
necessary for an effective and efficient NSW. Integrating other systems is also essential.

The integration of the NSW with the NTR/ASEAN Trade Repository should be pursued as
they are complementary in providing information and facilitating the clearance of goods.
A fully integrated system -- not only providing links, but actual integration of the systems

- would allow the clearance of goods based on the information required and the
regulations in place.

Government policy should be examined to find ways to align the working hours of border
agencies in Thailand. This is especially important for Thailand because of the multiple
borders it shares with other AMS.

139

**5.5.** **Cross-Border Coordination and Transit Facilitation**

Leveraging the existing ASEAN bodies as a forum to explore memoranda of understanding
with other AMS for transborder institutional arrangements and cooperation should be
considered.

**5.6.** **Transport Facilitation**

The various agreements should be implemented by expediting ratification, and
developing enabling legislation and rules and regulations. Thailand should work with
other AMS, as some harmonisation of procedures is done at the regional level, especially
for protocols that require regional agreement.

**5.7.** **E-Commerce**

The conclusion of the ASEAN e-commerce framework brings momentum to the work and
development of e-commerce in the region. Thailand, as an active user and proponent of
e-commerce, could support and lead in areas such as the revenue collection framework
and online dispute settlement, especially in areas that are still being considered and
studies are being conducted and pursued.

##### Chapter 11 Trade Facilitation in Viet Nam and Results of the ASTFI Baseline Study [1]

_Doan Thi Thanh Ha and Le Quang Lan_

**1.** **Overall Trade Facilitation Environment**

Economic regulatory reform in Viet Nam started in the early 1990s and accelerated when
the country shifted its focus to economic integration policy by acceding to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 and engaging in regional free trade agreements in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As the multilateral and regional trade
negotiations of Viet Nam progressed, the trade facilitation agenda emerged as one of the
key components of trade regulatory reform and liberalisation in the form of
harmonisation of trade regimes, transparency enhancement, and the removal of tariffs
and other business fees for enterprises.

In 2005, as a member of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Viet Nam committed
to undertaking trade facilitation measures in response to the APEC leaders' call for a
reduction in trade transaction costs of 5% by 2006 and a further reduction of 5% by 2010
at the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Busan. Trade facilitation plays a crucial role in
Viet Nam's Socio-Economic Development Strategy, 2011--2020, which aimed to improve
the country's business environment with the objective of sustaining trade growth and
doubling GDP per capita by 2020 compared with 2011. The strategy was translated into
various legal instruments, including government decrees and ministerial decisions on
improving the business environment and national competitiveness and on policy to
support Viet Nam's enterprises. These legal documents are amongst the most influential
legal frameworks guiding the trade facilitation process in Viet Nam until today.

The entry into force of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in 2016 brought new
momentum to push Viet Nam's trade facilitation agenda forward in a more coherent and
systematic manner. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) estimated that the implementation of the WTO TFA alone could reduce trade
costs in Viet Nam by 18.3% (OECD, 2015). On 4 October 2016, the Prime Minister issued
a decision to establish the National Steering Committee on the ASEAN Single Window, the
National Single Window, and Trade Facilitation (NATF). The NATF functions as the National
Trade Facilitation Committee of Viet Nam in accordance with the WTO TFA. Following this
decision, the Ministry of Finance, represented by the General Department of Customs of
Viet Nam or Vietnam Customs, was assigned as the coordinator for the implementation
of the trade facilitation plans. The government agencies tasked with coordinating with the
Ministry of Finance to implement the WTO TFA's commitments include the Ministry of

Industry and Trade (MOIC); the Ministry of Transport; the Ministry of Science and
Technology; the Ministry of Information and Communications; the Ministry of Health; the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD); the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Environment; the Ministry of National Defence; the Ministry of Culture, Sports and
Tourism; and Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI). On 13 October 2016,
the Prime Minister of Viet Nam issued a decision approving a plan for the preparation and
implementation of the WTO TFA, which set out a concrete mechanism to direct and
monitor the trade facilitation process at all administrative levels -- from central to local
government agencies. Viet Nam formulated a schedule to implement trade facilitation
measures, which are classified into categories A, B, and C in line with the WTO TFA
provisions, and submitted the schedule in its notification to the WTO on 15 October 2014.

Viet Nam's economic growth is highly dependent on trade performance, with a high level
of trade openness of about 200% of gross domestic product (GDP) (World Bank, 2017).
Trade is considered the major driver of the country's economic growth. In other words,
trade facilitation was the key behind Viet Nam's economic success in recent years, and
the government has shown continued commitment to pursue an ambitious and
comprehensive plan for trade facilitation. According to the OECD Report on Trade
Facilitation Indicators in 2019, Viet Nam matched or even exceeded the average
performance of high middle-income countries in all trade facilitation indicators. Trade
facilitation performance improved remarkably from 2017 to 2019 in many areas,
particularly in information availability, advance rulings, fees and charges, automation of
customs procedure and documents, and streamlining of customs procedures. [2] The
assessment was reaffirmed by the World Bank in its report on Doing Business in 2018,
which shows that Viet Nam's overall rank in the Doing Business Index in 2018 moved up
14 places from 82 to 68 out of 190 economies (World Bank, 2018b: 2). According to the
World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI) conducted in 2018, Viet Nam's global
ranking jumped 25 incremental places to 39 [th] in 2018 from 64 [th] in 2016, marking a crucial
leap forward in simplifying customs procedures and enlarging investment in the logistics
structure to enhance its connectivity (World Bank, 2018a: 1). Thanks to continuous efforts
and consistent commitment by the government in implementing trade facilitation
measures, the trade revenue increased 12% to nearly $480 billion in 2018. Viet Nam is
amongst the 30 largest trading partners in the world and it exports to more than
200 countries.

Despite the remarkable progress in trade facilitation, remaining challenges risk hampering
the sustainability of such progress. Imported goods are subject to more than 300 legal
documents which are issued and maintained by line ministries or government agencies.
Significant resources and time are needed for traders to comply with the complex trade
regulations. In 2017, about 57.5% of goods were designated to the green lane where

customs examination is largely exempted, 37.4% of imported goods went through the
yellow lane for closer examination, and 5.1% of imported goods were subject to physical
examination in the red lane. These numbers are higher than those of neighbouring
countries of a similar level of economic development in ASEAN. According to a survey
conducted by the VCCI on the measurement of Vietnamese businesses' satisfaction with
customs procedures in 2017 (Thoi bao tai chinh Vietnam Online, 2017), 46% of traders
indicated that they had difficulty complying with the customs procedures while 23% of
traders were not satisfied with the coordination between customs and relevant agencies,
which caused delays in customs clearance. Similarly, findings from the survey showed that
only 20% of traders were fully satisfied with the quality and competency of customs
agencies. Many traders expressed their disappointment over uncertain and nontransparent administrative formalities and procedures. Furthermore, limited
infrastructure capacity and lack of efficient logistics and transport are negatively impeding
the flow of goods. The government needs to carry out significant work to ensure that
trade facilitation measures can benefit traders and the whole economy.

**2.** **Trade Facilitation Environment -- Customs Authority**

Customs procedures form a larger part of relevant measures in trade facilitation and are
set out under _the Customs Law_ No. 54/2014/QH13 dated 23 June 2014 and its numerous
implementing decrees and guiding circulars. All imported and exported goods are subject
to customs procedures, which effectively check the quality, specifications, quantity, and
volume of goods. In addition, thousands of goods items are subject to sectoral inspections
undertaken by line ministries or agencies. When goods are exported or imported, traders
must submit a dossier of documents to customs authorities -- typically including bills of
lading, cargo release orders, commercial invoices, customs import declaration forms,
inspection reports, packing lists, and technical standard/health certificates. Although
sectoral inspection is essential to ensure the full compliance of exports and imports with
mandatory standards, quality, quantity, and sanitary or phytosanitary regulations issued
by line agencies or ministries, traders often spend most of their time and resources
navigating complex procedures maintained by those line agencies or ministries rather
than the procedures regulated by Vietnam Customs. Therefore, the simplification and
modernisation of customs procedures require a great deal of coordination between
customs authorities and line agencies or ministries.

Following the government's adoption of the Strategy for Customs Development 2020,
Vietnam Customs aimed to build a modern customs infrastructure that supports the
operation of a transparent and efficient data exchange platform for customs clearance,
taking into account international best practices and standards. Since 2014, Viet Nam has
deployed an automated customs clearance system which incorporates two components

- the Vietnam Automated Cargo Clearance System (VNACCS) and the Vietnam Customs
Intelligence Information System (VCIS). The VNACCS/VICS integrates all necessary
customs processes in a single automation and electronic platform that caters for ecustoms dossiers, e-manifests, e-payments, and e-licences in line with international

144

standards. The system enables enterprises or traders to register and submit their customs
declarations electronically. It automatically calculates applicable taxes and duties to be
paid, and alerts customs officers if the goods are declared incorrectly. The system can also
generate a code for each shipment and designate the shipment to the respective red,
green, or yellow channels based on their risk management methodology for customs
control.

The VNACCS/VCIS underpins the operation of the National Single Window (NSW) and the
ASEAN Single Window (ASW) to accommodate effective connection and data exchange
between (i) regional data processing centres throughout the country; and (ii) Viet Nam's
ASW gateway and the ASW gateways of other ASEAN Member States (AMS) in the
production environment. According to the strategy for Customs Development 2020, all
customs authorities at points of entry (e.g. seaports, airports, land border checkpoints,
and economic zones) will apply the electronic customs clearance system to accommodate
basic customs procedures. It was estimated that some 80% of traders, whose trade
turnover consists of more than 90% of total turnover, would be ready to use the system
by 2020 (Vietnam Customs, a). The plan also sets out the goal of reducing the customs
processing time to a level which is comparable to that of advanced developing countries.

**3.** **Results from the ASTFI Survey**

A survey on the ASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators (ASTFI) was conducted
amongst major relevant agencies in Viet Nam -- including customs, the MARD, the MOIC,
the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of
Transport. Contact persons in the respective agencies were requested to respond to
questionnaires based on their knowledge and expertise. Experts and independent local
consultants of the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) verified the
answers against the available information.

**3.1.** **Transparency of information**

Viet Nam performs quite well under this component. In terms of transparency and
information on laws, regulations, and procedures, Vietnam Customs has put into
operation a centralised system which regularly updates necessary information about the
customs law and regulations, procedures, tariff books, export and import customs
documents and updated guidance, and decisions from Vietnam Customs to local customs
authorities. The website offers a broad range of online public services provided by
customs authorities, including an online tariff rate finder; an e-payment system for taxes,
duties, fees, and charges; online customs declarations; and tracking of the customs
clearance process. Furthermore, the website is designed to render a high level of
interaction between customs authorities and traders through friendly electronic interface
tools to assist traders to address their concerns in a timely manner through online enquiry
points or call centres. More remarkably, all information and communication in the system
is available in both Vietnamese and English.

145

In supporting the efforts of Vietnam Customs, major line ministry agencies also provide
information on their respective trade regulations, and import and export procedures and
guidelines, on their respective websites. Traders can access this information without
incurring any fees or charges. The NATF is the body responsible for monitoring the
implementation of the publication and transparency obligations of relevant ministries and
agencies.

On the National Trade Repository (NTR), while certain information is made available, the
non-tariff measures (NTMs) database and best practices in trade facilitation have not yet
been completed. Despite many efforts to consolidate the NTM database, with technical
support from the European Union and ERIA, Viet Nam was not able to develop a reliable
NTM database or provide best practices for traders. The NTR website, which is operated
by MOIC (MOIC, n.d.), is primarily designed to be the NTR of Viet Nam, covering all nine
elements of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA). The NTR website,
nevertheless, does not work properly and contains outdated and obsolete information.
As a result, there is only minimal traffic on the website. On the contrary, the Vietnam
Trade Portal (in Vietnamese: Cong Thong tin Thuong mai Viet Nam), operated by Vietnam
Customs, provides sufficient and updated content to serve traders, though its interface is
modelled differently (Vietnam Trade Portal, n.d.). It contains a wide range of practical and
updated information, with several interactive tools that enable traders to search or sort
information easily. The low usage of the NTR raises a question regarding how the NTR is
still relevant to businesses or traders. Meanwhile, some alternative sources, such as the
websites of line ministries (particularly the Ministry of Finance, Vietnam Customs, and the
MOIC), could better serve traders' information demands.

**3.2.** **Communication and active engagement of the private sector**

Viet Nam's performance is outstanding in this aspect. The highest body that coordinates
the implementation of trade facilitation is the NATF, which is chaired by a Deputy Prime
Minister and coordinated by the Ministry of Finance (Vietnam Customs) (Cong Thong Tin
Thuong Mai Viet Nam, 2016). The NATF covers three strategic initiatives, including (i) the
ASW, (ii) the NSW, and (iii) the implementation of trade facilitation measures under the
WTO TFA. The NATF functions as a government steering body which is responsible for
monitoring the implementation of Viet Nam's obligations on trade facilitation under the
WTO TFA, setting up consultations with traders and stakeholders, establishing a
mechanism to fulfil the objectives of reducing trade transaction costs, and speeding up
the movement of goods. The NATF does not specify whether the private sector could
aspire to full membership under its institutional structure. However, an ad hoc
consultation mechanism with the private sector could be initiated by the chair of the VCCI,
a semi-government body which represents the interests of the business community in
Viet Nam and is a full member of the NATF. Since its establishment in 2016, the NATF has
addressed many bottlenecks to trade in the country. It also determines how to expedite
specific mandates, as reflected in a work plan of coordination amongst the relevant
ministries or agencies in implementing various trade facilitation measures.

146

On the mechanism to engage stakeholders, especially micro, small, and medium-sized
enterprises, Viet Nam has implemented a relatively good mechanism with a view to
empowering stakeholders to participate effectively in the drafting of laws and regulations.
Public feedback and comments on draft regulations regarding trade-related measures
(including NTMs) are strictly required by law. Any ministry or agency which is responsible
for drafting a regulation must publish the draft on their website and organise
consultations in appropriate formats to receive public comments and input. All
stakeholder inputs and comments are taken into consideration. Drafting agencies are
legally required to observe a strict timeline for seeking and responding to public
comments. To foster this process, cross-ministerial verification of the content of the draft
regulation must be undertaken before the responsible bodies can promulgate or issue the
regulation. The Ministry of Justice and functional committees of the National Assembly
are responsible for reviewing the draft laws and regulations to ensure that they
adequately address all legitimate stakeholder concerns. Although no special facility is in
place to accommodate direct consultations or dialogue with micro, small, and mediumsized enterprises, stakeholders may reflect their concerns or interest via the appropriate
mechanisms. Furthermore, public feedback through the media, press, and social networks
are contributing significantly to the drafting of laws and regulations in Viet Nam.

**3.3.** **Release and clearance formalities**

Vietnam Customs has successfully put in place an effective customs control system with
formalities and methods based on risk management, in accordance with international
best practice. The system allows local or regional customs agencies to create alerts at any
point during the customs procedure in an integrated computerised system controlled by
Vietnam Customs. Nevertheless, while Vietnam Customs is accelerating its efforts to
harmonise risk management practices for customs clearance, relevant major agencies
have not done enough to fulfil this objective. It is not clear when and how risk
management approaches based on international best practice could be commonly
applied by other major agencies. At this juncture, Vietnam Customs is prioritising its
resources to harmonise and integrate customs procedures in an electronic production
environment under the NSW. It is expected that risk management could be identified as
the next step for harmonisation, in collaboration with other line ministries or agencies.

With respect to an e-payment system for public services, Vietnam Customs is amongst
the pioneer agencies that have successfully deployed an advanced e-payment system for
tax and duty collection. [3] On 26 September 2017, the Vietnam Customs e-payment system
was officially launched on a designated platform embedded in the customs website
(Vietnam Customs, a). Any trader that completes the online registration for e-payment
can access the service around the clock (24/7). Once the trader completes the submission
of the digital customs declaration, the e-payment system automatically generates the
necessary information and calculates the amount of taxes or fees payable by that trader.

3 Following Decision No. 241/QĐ-TTg dated 23 February 2018 on Approving a Plan to Encourage Electronic
Payment Through Commercial Banks for Tariff Duties, Taxes, Electricity, School Fees, Hospital Fees, and
Other Social Security Charges.

147

Some e-payment systems are also available on major agencies' websites (e.g. the MOIC
and the MARD) to accommodate certain e-payments for administrative fees and charges.
However, an integrated e-payment system that enables traders to pay the full amount of
taxes, tariff duties, fees, and charges in relation to exports and imports has yet to be fully
realised.

Dwell time publication is the indicator measuring the time that cargo spends within the
port between unloading and pickup. It is considered one of the most accurate indicators
to measure the efficiency of the logistics sector in a country. The World Customs
Organization (WCO) uses dwell time to help customs authorities identify bottlenecks in
the customs clearance process and optimise their operations to reduce trade transaction
costs and promote the timely delivery of exported and imported goods. This indicator
provides a key benchmark of trade facilitation and encourages concerned customs
agencies to simplify and modernise customs and transport procedures to strengthen the
logistics industry. However, Viet Nam has not fully conducted dwell time publication as it
is prioritizing the Time Release Study (TRS) as an alternative. No plan is yet specified for
Vietnam Customs to adopt dwell time at this juncture.

Viet Nam conducted its first TRS in 2013 and updates it annually. The TRS is implemented
at 11 customs entry points in seven provinces and cities for three types of transport -- sea,
air, and land. A full TRS has not been published, but some of the key TRS results could be
released by Vietnam Customs. A multiple stakeholder workshop is held by Vietnam
Customs in collaboration with the VCCI each year, with the participation of
representatives of the Asian Development Bank, WCO, government agencies, and
business associations to share the outcome of the TRS and receive feedback.

With regard to trade facilitation measures for Trusted Traders or Authorised Economic
Operators (AEOs), in 2015, Vietnam Customs introduced a trusted economic operators
scheme for domestic enterprises or traders based on the WCO model for AEOs and the
WTO authorised operator scheme. However, the actual progress of implementation is
rather slow. Most AEOs are large national or international companies with well-structured
records that demonstrate their full compliance with requirements. Meanwhile, most
small and medium-sized enterprises may have difficulty meeting the AEO requirements.
This potentially causes unreasonable and unfair treatment in customs procedures.

Regarding self-certification of rules of origin (ROO), the full operation of the ASEAN-wide
Self-Certification (AWSC) scheme was a remarkable milestone in ASEAN trade facilitation,
following two self-certification pilot projects in 2010 and 2014. The ASWC is a unified
scheme that allows Trusted Traders who can demonstrate their capacity to comply with
ROO requirements to self-declare the origin of their export under the ATIGA. This progress
paves a good foundation for Viet Nam to continue its reforms and enhance its trade
facilitation agenda. Efforts are under way to expand the pilot project to non-ASEAN
trading partners under free trade agreements between ASEAN and its Dialogue Partners.
Nevertheless, the progress of ASWC deployment is still slow due to the lack of capacity of
local businesses.

148

Post-clearance audit (PCA) involves examination or review to be conducted by customs
and other agencies authorities on imported or exported goods after goods have been
released from customs control. In general, Vietnam Customs maintains the PCA system
based on international best practice and standards, as recommended by the WCO.
According to Articles 77 and 78 of the Customs Law No. 54/2014/QH13, customs and
other major agencies can perform PCAs based on risk management. However, not all
agencies have adopted risk management based on international best practice for PCA.

**3.4.** **Import and export formalities**

Viet Nam's performance is impressive under this component. The NSW is a powerful tool
that simplifies import and export formalities. It enables traders to submit documents
electronically necessary documents including customs declarations, commercial invoices,
transport documents, licences, permits, certificates of origin, quality certificates, and
other required documents to customs authorities for customs clearance. In a fully
integrated system, with an NSW connecting all relevant ministries and agencies, the
customs agencies which receive a complete set of the required documents seek
collaboration from line ministries or agencies through appropriate platforms on the NSW
to examine, access, and decide whether to release the goods. [4] Since the process is fully
automated, traders are able to track the progress of their application for import and
export licensing, certificates of origin issuance, or customs clearance.

Thanks to the continuous endeavours of the Vietnamese government, the NSW has
progressed at a remarkable pace. Since the establishment of a pilot NSW in 2011, the NSW
has successfully accommodated paperless documentation amongst 13 line ministries,
with more than 207 electronic documents exchanged on the NSW for customs
procedures. Additional resources and time are required to streamline and harmonise
processes and documentation to be exchanged electronically on the NSW as Vietnam
Customs continues its unwavering commitment to fully maximise the use of NSW as a
means to accelerate customs modernisation in the country.

The progress of the NSW underlies the active participation of Viet Nam in the ASW. The
ASW is a decentralised system in which electronic documents are exchanged through the
ASW platform that connects the NSWs. The success of the ASW mirrors the level of
operational effectiveness of the respective NSWs. In 2018, Viet Nam and four other AMS
(i.e. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand) were implementing the ASW by
exchanging the electronic Form D in the production environment of the ASW.

**3.5.** **Cross-border coordination with neighbouring countries**

Viet Nam's performance is rather modest in this area. A coordination mechanism was
established to harmonise procedures amongst different agencies domestically and with
their counterparts in other countries (e.g. Cambodia, China, and the Lao People's
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)). Such procedures include the examination of goods,

4 Decision No. 448/QĐ-TTg of the Prime Minister dated 25 March 2011; and the Law on Customs
No. 54/2014/QH13 dated 23 June 2014.

149

people, means of transport, and movement of goods for customs purposes such as duty,
taxes and charges, import and export restrictive measures and quotas, quality regulations,
and standards. The three operational components for the coordination mechanism
include sharing common facilities, joint control, and alignment of working hours amongst
relevant agencies, especially line agencies or ministries. Progress largely depends on
tremendous coordination efforts by all relevant agencies, as well as the capacity and
political will of neighbouring countries.

Progress in setting up facilities and legal instruments for a computerised transit and transit
guarantee mechanism remains slow. The trade transit regime in the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS) falls under the GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement (GMS-CBTA),
which is being supported by technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank. To
date, the CBTA has been signed and ratified by all six GMS countries: Cambodia, China,
the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The provisions of the GMS customs
transit system (GMS-CTS), i.e. the trade transit regime, are set out in Annex 6 of the CBTA
and related technical attachments and protocols.

Viet Nam does not have specific regulations on transit guarantees. The purchase of
guarantees for goods in transit has not been _de facto_ considered a legally mandatory
obligation because it is widely recognised that goods in transit are not subject to customs
duties, fees, or charges imposed by any government agencies. New legislation on transit
guarantees will likely be introduced as long as Viet Nam honours its commitments to
facilitating the movement of goods in transit under the GMS and ASEAN. This process may
take time and resources to set up necessary enabling infrastructure and familiarise
customs officers and businesses.

Viet Nam has no specific regime for Authorised Transit Traders (ATTs). Nevertheless, it
provides simplified procedures for trusted or priority traders who operate in the provision
of services for goods in transit. Any qualified trader that meets Vietnam Customs' criteria
or conditions is eligible for a priority or fast-track customs lane (i.e green lane) in which
goods can be immediately released for import or export without closer customs
examination. The scope of simplified procedures for ATTs could be expanded or even be
strengthened in line with the implementation of the ASEAN Customs Transit System and
the GMS-CTS.

**3.6.** **Transport facilitation**

Viet Nam's performance under this component is rather modest. Transport facilitation
requires a great deal of collaboration between neighbouring countries in ASEAN.
However, the issuance of ASEAN goods vehicle cross-border permits and the
harmonisation of land transport facilitation procedures through the operationalisation of
protocols 1, 2, and 4 have not progressed well. The implementation of those protocols
faces extremely difficulty due to the lack of commitment by AMS, insufficient
infrastructure investment, and possible conflicts between vested interests in the
transport sector. The slow progress of the ratification of the ASEAN Framework
Agreement on the Facilitation of Inter-State Transport (AFAFIST) and the ASEAN

150

Framework Agreement on Multimodal Transport (AFAMT) continues to be the major
impediment to ASEAN cooperation in this area. Despite this challenge, Viet Nam has
unilaterally implemented electronic data interchange at some ports to speed up the
movement of cargo at key ports, giving some hope for improving trade facilitation in this
area.

**3.7.** **E-commerce**

Viet Nam performs moderately under this component. Three activity variables under the
ASTFI were used to capture e-commerce performance: (i) the implementation of a legal
framework and the operationalisation of interoperable, mutually recognised, secure, and
user-friendly e-identification and authorisation; (ii) a revenue collection framework for
cross-border e-commerce trade; and (iii) a legal framework for domestic and cross-border
e-commerce dispute settlement. Although the current ASTFI may not directly reflect the
contribution of e-commerce to trade facilitation, the implementation of these three
measures based on international best practice is essential to the success of e-commerce
for the country and the progress of trade facilitation in the new digital age.

Viet Nam is doing rather well in promoting the country's e-commerce. According to the
Vietnam E-commerce Association (VECOM) in 2017, 30% of Viet Nam's population could
engage in online shopping by 2020, with per capita purchasing value reaching $350 per
year. VECOM also estimated that the annual growth rate of e-commerce in Viet Nam was
about 22% in 2017 and could reach 30%--50% per year in the coming years (Nhan Dan,
2018). The growth of e-commerce gives rise to business-to-consumer (B2C) and businessto-business (B2B) transactions. It incentivises the use of cashless payments and paperless
documentation (e.g. e-invoices and e-signatures) amongst traders and consumers. This
poses an immense opportunity for Viet Nam to boost e-commerce and modernise
logistics sector so that it can significantly reduce transaction costs.

**4.** **Conclusions and Recommendations**

The implementation of trade facilitation in Viet Nam has been progressing steadily in
many areas, with the involvement of all government agencies -- especially Vietnam
Customs and major agencies including the MOIC, the MARD, and the Ministry of Health.
The entry into force of the WTO TFA gave new momentum to the process. Under the
coordination of the NATF, which is under the direct supervision of the government, the
policy agenda for trade facilitation has been conducted more strategically and in a
coherent manner. Significant resources and efforts, as well as strong political
commitment, are necessary to keep the process moving forwards.

Despite good progress in trade facilitation, Viet Nam should not be complacent. A number
of outstanding obstacles to trade need to be addressed expeditiously. Traders still find it
difficult and time-consuming to deal with line agencies and ministries' excessive
administrative procedures, especially in relation to customs clearance. The enhancement
of transparency, simplification and harmonisation of procedures, and customs

151

modernisation -- with a focus on the operation of the NSW -- continue to be policy
mandates consistently pursued by the Vietnamese government. In this connection, the
application of information technology may offer effective and innovative solutions to
many of those obstacles. However, it does not mean that the progress may be achieved
without challenges. Instead, it requires stronger determination from the relevant
agencies or ministries and greater resources and financial investment to enhance the
appropriate infrastructure and human capacity.

In an attempt to achieve a robust region-wide trade facilitation agenda, ASEAN has been
expediting a number of initiatives and measures under the AEC 2025 Trade Facilitation
Strategic Action Plan (TFSAP), with the clearly identified objectives of reducing trade
transaction costs in the AEC by 10% by 2020 and doubling intra-ASEAN trade from 2017
to 2025. The plan also aims to improve the performance in global rankings/surveys,
e.g. the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report and the World Bank's
Ease of Doing Business. The implementation of the TFSAP complements ongoing
endeavours undertaken by each AMS. Biennial surveys on trade facilitation using the
ASTFI, as specified in the TFSAP, are a meaningful policy tool to assist individual AMS to
address bottlenecks or outstanding issues while advancing trade facilitation policy goals.
The ASTFI provide a score for each trade facilitation measure undertaken by an AMS based
on prescribed parameters. Although the ASTFI do not dictate when and how a concerned
AMS implements the measures, they are a powerful instrument to demonstrate how an
AMS has performed in promoting trade facilitation and to assist that AMS to decide how
to prioritise trade facilitation measures given its specific circumstances and limited
resources.

The current ASTFI scores proved that Viet Nam had made substantive progress in the
areas of transparency and publication of laws, regulations, and procedures. An effective
mechanism for communication with and active engagement of stakeholders, especially in
the private sector, has been put in place. Progress is steady in customs release and
clearance formalities -- from advance rulings, fees and charges, documents, and
automation, to streamlining of procedures. On the other hand, dwell time publication, epayment self-certification, and trade facilitation measures for Trusted Traders or AEOs
are the most contentious areas that need to be strengthened for effective use by traders.

Much work has been done regarding import and export formalities and coordination,
especially in the realisation of the ASW/NSW. The operationalisation of ASW/NSW plays
a pioneer role in the modernisation and simplification of the procedures of customs and
other major line agencies and ministries. One of the biggest challenges remains in the
attempt to harmonise those various procedures in a single digital platform for electronic
exchange of information amongst relevant agencies. In this regard, the leading role of
Vietnam Customs in the NSW should be fostered to coordinate inter-ministerial agencies.
Once the NSW is fully operational, it could unleash new energy to the overall trade
facilitation process in the country.

152

Outstanding challenges remains formidable in cross-border coordination, transit, and
transport areas, where progress is conditional on the level of commitment of the
concerned countries to realise some key ASEAN trade facilitation initiatives in transit (e.g.
the ASEAN Customs Transit System) or other regional schemes (e.g. the GMS-CTS).
However, some progress has been made in border agency institutional coordination and
cross-border operational coordination with neighbouring countries to support the
traditional movement of goods in transit.

E-commerce is not only the most dynamic factor for economic growth but also the major
catalyst for trade facilitation. It substantively brings down the cost of doing business,
while promoting productivity and consumption efficiency. The results of the ASTFI have
pointed out a number of outstanding difficulties, particularly in establishing a new legal
framework on e-commerce. In this connection, Viet Nam needs to prioritise its resources
to formulate a comprehensive regulatory framework on e-commerce that strikes a
balance between the promotion of trade and investment in industry and the creation of
a trustworthy, secure legal environment for fair competition and consumer protection,
including the protection of personal data.

The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), together with the ASEAN Trade Facilitation Joint
Consultative Committee (ATFJCC), has developed an ASEAN-specific trade facilitation indicator called the ASEAN Seamless
Trade Facilitation Indicators (ASTFI). The ASTFI is based on a survey of major trade-related government agencies of each
ASEAN Member State. It includes measures on transparency and engagement with the private sector, the core trade
facilitation measures of clearance and release formalities, as well as export and import formalities and coordination, and
measures for transit, transport, and e-commerce facilitations. A report on the ASTFI Baseline Study was submitted to the
ATFJCC in July 2018.

This public version of the report provides the status and progress of the trade facilitation environment in ASEAN and in
ASEAN Member States, highlighting trade facilitation efforts and best practices in ASEAN, as well as in each ASEAN Member
State as of 2018. The finding is that, by 2018, ASEAN Member States had done well in transparency and information on
laws, regulations, and procedures, as well as in components related to communication with and active engagement with
the private sector. Under these components, ASEAN Member States had established informative and user-friendly websites
containing customs and trade-related laws and regulations. Best practices by leading ASEAN Member States in the region
with respect to the engagement between the government and the private sector were also highlighted and these serve
as benchmarks for other ASEAN Member States. Moderate progress was seen in the release and clearance formalities
component, cross-border coordination, and transit facilitation, where ASEAN transport-related protocols had yet to be
implemented.

Much remained to be done in many of the ASEAN Member States and in the region to move towards a seamless trade
facilitation environment, but progress had been made. A follow-up ASTFI survey, being conducted in 2020 and 2021, will
assess the progress in trade facilitation since the 2018 baseline and the attendant improvement in the trading environment
in ASEAN.
