# **GOALS**

Increased trade flows, by facilitating the efficient movement of goods across borders, with the following measurable targets:

  - Reduction in trade transactions cost in the AEC (by 10% by 2020)

  - Doubling of intra-ASEAN trade between 2017 and 2025

  - Improved performance in global rankings/surveys e.g. World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report (WEF-GCR),
