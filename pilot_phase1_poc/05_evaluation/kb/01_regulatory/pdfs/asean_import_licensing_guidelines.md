**Guidelines for the Implementation of**
**Import Licensing Procedures in ASEAN**

(03.08.2011)

**A. PREAMBLE**

In pursuit of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC),
guided by the ASEAN Charter, and in accordance with the
ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement ("ATIGA") and the
WTO Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures ("WTO
ILA"), this Guidelines for the Implementation of Import
Licensing Procedures ("ILP Guidelines") for the
minimization of the barrier elements of import licensing
systems consistent with Article 44 (Import Licensing
Procedures) of ATIGA is hereby adopted. These
guidelines shall not replace, alter or in any way change
the rights and obligations of ASEAN Member States as set
out in the ATIGA and WTO ILA.

Recognising that the full implementation of this ILP
Guidelines would enhance national welfare for each
Member State, particularly for the core disciplines of
transparency and non-discrimination, and in response to
the call of the Eminent Persons Group on the ASEAN
Charter during the 12 [th] ASEAN Summit in Cebu for
Member States to "calibrate the traditional policy of nonintervention in areas where the common interest dictates
closer cooperation", ASEAN Member States agree to
establish a peer review mechanism to learn from each
other's experiences, enhance policy-relevant interaction,
and encourage Member States to move towards
unimpeded trade flows necessary for realizing the AEC by
2015.

To that end, each Member State has agreed to adhere to
these guidelines as set out in the following understanding.

**B. DEFINITIONS**

Page **1** of **9**

Import licensing, as defined in the WTO ILA, refers to
administrative procedures [1] used for the operation of
import licensing regimes requiring the submission of an
application or other documentation (other than those
required for customs purposes) to the relevant
administrative body as a prior condition for importation into
the customs territory of the importing member.

Automatic import licensing, as defined in Article 2.1 of the
WTO ILA, is import licensing where approval of the
application is granted in all cases, and which is in
accordance with the requirements of Article 2.2(a) of the
WTO ILA so as to not have a restricting effect on imports
subject to such automatic licensing.

Non-automatic import licensing is defined as import
licensing not falling within the definition contained in
paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the WTO ILA.

Quotas or quantitative restrictions are restrictions on
specific products where maximum quantities or values of
goods are authorized for import.

ASEAN Harmonized Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN), the 8digit commodity classification system, adopted by Member
States in 2002.

**C. OBJECTIVES**

This ILP Guidelines is in accordance with the ATIGA and
WTO rights and obligations. It aims to:

(a) simplify and make transparent import licensing

systems;

1 Those procedures referred to as "licensing" as well as other similar
administrative procedures

Page **2** of **9**

(b) ensure their uniform and equitable application and

reasonable and impartial administration;

(c) ensure that the restrictions governed by such import

licensing mechanisms are justified within the WTO
legal framework; and

(d) prevent procedures applied for granting import

licenses from having in themselves, restrictive or
distortive effects on imports.

For this purpose, elements in non-automatic licensing that
impede trade are identified with a view to removing such
barriers that are not in accordance to rights and
obligations under WTO and ATIGA and working towards
automatic import licensing to the extent possible.

This ILP Guidelines lay down the actions that are
necessary for reducing or eliminating those elements of
import licensing systems that run counter to the principles
of neutrality, transparency, and predictability of import
licensing systems.

**D. SCOPE**

Import licensing systems encompass import licensing
procedures and their underlying rules and regulations,
requirements and manner of implementation.

These ILP Guidelines encompass the rules and
regulations, requirements, procedures, as well as the
manner of implementation by Member States of their
respective import licensing systems, i.e. from the
submission of the application, to the evaluation and
approval of the license.

Each guideline should be specifically implemented for
every commodity subject to import licensing.

**E. PERMITTED IMPORT LICENSING**

1. In general, Member States should not adopt or
maintain non-tariff restrictions or prohibitions through
import licensing or quotas on the importation of goods
from other Member States, except in accordance with that
Member State's WTO rights and obligations or the ATIGA.

Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member States may adopt
or maintain non-tariff restrictions through import licensing
or quotas as provided for under GATT 1994 and ATIGA:

(a) the application of standards or regulations for the

classification, grading, or marketing of
commodities _[GATT 1994 Art XI Para 2b]_ ;

(b) to restrict quantities or remove temporary
surpluses of domestic substitutes of agricultural or
fishery products or restrict production of animal
products that depend on the imported commodity

_[GATT 1994 Art XI Para 2c]_, provided public
notice is given on the total quantity or value of the
affected product, and the proportion of imports to
domestic production is not reduced _[GATT 1994_
_Art XI Para 2]_ ;

(c) measures to (i) protect public morals, (ii) protect

human, animal, and plant life and health, (iii)
conserve exhaustible natural resources, (iv)
protect national treasures; (v) secure compliance
with laws relating to customs enforcement,
monopolies, protection of intellectual property
rights, and prevention of deceptive practices;
measures relating to (vi) gold and silver, (vii)

Page **4** of **9**

products of prison labor, (xi) obligations under
intergovernmental commodity agreements, (xii)
products in temporary short supply; provided such
measures are not applied in a discriminatory
manner or are not a disguised restriction on trade

_[ATIGA Art 8]_ ;

(d) measures to protect national security relating to (i)

fissionable materials or raw materials, (ii) arms,
ammunition, implements of war, or military
supplies, (iii) critical public infrastructure, (iv)
domestic or international emergency, or (v)
obligations under the United Nations Charter for
international peace and security _[ATIGA Art 9]_ .

(e) measures for balance-of-payment purposes

_[GATT 1994 Art XII, Annex 1A of the WTO_
_Agreement, ATIGA Art 10]_ ;

(f) waivers under exceptional cases for the special

consideration of rice and sugar _[ATIGA Art 24]_ ;

(g) measures relating to hazardous wastes or

substances _[ATIGA Art 42 Para 7];_

(h) monopoly of the importation of any product _[GATT_

_1994 Art 2 Para 4]._ ]

**F. GENERAL FEATURES OF PERMITTED IMPORT**

**LICENSING SYSTEMS**

In accordance with the procedures in the WTO ILA and
ATIGA:

(a) Import licensing systems of Member States should be

neutral, fair, equitable, transparent and predictable.

Page **5** of **9**

(b) Automatic import licensing may be used by Member

States when more appropriate procedures are not
available, but maintained only for as long as the
circumstances, which gave rise to its introduction,
prevail and as long as its underlying administrative
purposes cannot be achieved in a more appropriate
way.

(c) Non-automatic import licensing of Member States

should not have trade-restrictive or distortive effects
on imports in addition to those caused by the
imposition of the restriction.

(d) Elements in non-automatic import licensing that

impede trade should be identified with a view to
removing such barriers and working towards
automatic import licensing to the extent possible.

**G. TRANSPARENT GOODS COVERAGE**

Goods covered by import licensing systems should be
listed at the most disaggregated level of the AHTN, and to
the extent possible, published/notified.

**H. NEUTRALITY ACROSS APPLICANTS**

Applications for import licensing should be open to all
persons or entities that fulfill the legal and administrative
requirements of the Member State.

**I. TRANSPARENCY** **AND** **PREDICTABILITY**
**THROUGH PUBLICATION AND NOTIFICATION**

1. ILP should be subject to Articles 11 (Notification
Procedures), 12 (Publication and Administration of Trade
Regulations) and 44 (Import Licensing Procedures) of
ATIGA.

Page **6** of **9**

**J. TRANSPARENT** **AND** **PREDICTABLE**
**REQUIREMENTS**

1. Application forms and procedures should be simple
and require only information and documents that are
strictly necessary.

2. Applicants should have to approach only one
administrative body in connection with an application.
Where it is strictly indispensable to approach more than
one administrative body, applicants should not be required
to approach more than three administrative bodies.

**K. PREDICTABLE** **PERIOD** **OF** **SUBMISSION,**
**PROCESSING, VALIDITY**

1. Member States should allow a reasonable period for
the submission of the application, or at least sixty (60)
days if there is a closing date, with extension if an
insufficient number of applications were received within
this period.

2. For automatic import licensing, applications may be
submitted on any working day prior to the customs
clearance of the goods.

3. The license validity period should also be reasonable
and not be so short as to preclude imports from distant
sources.

**L. TRANSPARENT AND PREDICTABLE PROCESSING**

1. Applications for automatic import licensing that are
submitted in appropriate and complete form should be
approved immediately upon receipt or within ten (10)
working days.

Page **7** of **9**

2. For non-automatic import licensing, applications on a
first-come-first-served basis should be processed within
thirty (30) days, and those considered simultaneously,
within sixty (60) days, from the closing date of the
application period.

3. No application should be refused for minor
documentation errors. No penalty greater than a warning
should be given for omissions or mistakes that are
obviously made without fraudulent intent or gross
negligence.

4. Non-automatic licenses should be allocated taking into
account the applicant's import performance. Consideration
should be given as to whether licenses issued to
applicants in the past have been fully utilized during a
recent representative period. In cases where licenses
have not been fully utilized, the Member State should
examine the reasons for this and take these reasons into
consideration when allocating new licenses. Consideration
should also be given to ensuring a reasonable distribution
of licenses to new importers, taking into account the
desirability of issuing licenses for products in economic
quantities. Special consideration should be given to those
importers importing products originating in least developed
countries.

5. Unapproved applicants for non-automatic licenses
should be given the reason upon request and have the
right of appeal or review in accordance with the domestic
regulation or procedures of importing Members.

**M. EFFECTING THE LICENSED IMPORTATION**

1. Licensed imports should not be refused entry for
minor variations in value, quantity, or weight from that

Page **8** of **9**

specified in the license, that are due to normal handling
and transport.

2. For quotas, Member States should not prevent
importation from being effected in accordance with the
issued license nor discourage full utilization.

3. For non-automatic import licensing, in applying
paragraph 8 of Article 1 of the WTO Agreement on Import
Licensing Procedures, compensating adjustments may be
made in future license allocations where imports exceed a
previous license level _._

**N. IMPLEMENTATION AND PEER REVIEW**

1. This ILP Guidelines should be implemented in
accordance with Chapter 4 (Non-Tariff Measures) of
ATIGA.

2. A peer review system to assess the implementation
progress of a Member State by other Member States
should be established to encourage conformity with this
ILP Guidelines and adherence to commitments.

3. Member States should commit to transparency and
information sharing that is required by the peer review
system. Guidelines A to M above shall serve as the
criteria against which performance will be reviewed.
