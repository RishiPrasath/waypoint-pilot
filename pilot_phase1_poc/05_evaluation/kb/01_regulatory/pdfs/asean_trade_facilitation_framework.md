# **ASEAN Trade Facilitation Framework**

**I** **INTRODUCTION**

1 Trade facilitation is a recognized driver of economic development and regional
integration. It plays a key role with respect to the realization of the goal of establishing ASEAN
as a single market and production base, which is stable, prosperous, highly competitive and
economically integrated, with effective facilitation for trade and investment, in which there is
free flow of goods, services and investment.

2 Important drivers of trade facilitation, as well as several trade facilitation obligations
and commitments, already inform ASEAN Member States' trade and economic relations within
ASEAN. These are evident in the _ASEAN Charter_, _ASEAN Vision 2025: Forging Ahead Together:_
_ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025,_ and _ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement_ (ATIGA).
Noting trade facilitation disciplines are also evident in the _Trade Facilitation Agreement_ under
the _World Trade Organization_ (WTO) and within the framework of the _Revised International_
_Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (the revised Kyoto_
_Convention)_, which was adopted by the _World Customs Organization_ (WCO).

3 The _ASEAN Trade Facilitation Framework_ (ATFF) aims at consolidating these elements
and it provides a basis upon which ASEAN Member States (AMSs) can further engage and
foster greater trade facilitation regionally and within the relevant ASEAN sectoral bodies. The
ATFF focuses on effective implementation of the existing ASEAN obligations, commitments and
instruments relating to trade facilitation. The added value of the ATFF rests in the desire of
AMSs to provide a coordinated and renewed impetus towards trade facilitation within the
ASEAN region.

4. While avoiding overlaps among ASEAN subsidiary bodies and initiatives, the ATFF
shall be developed and implemented through a comprehensive _ASEAN Trade Facilitation Work_
_Programme_ geared to achieve specific and measurable deliverables, strengthen the role of
micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), increase market access opportunities
and promote exports, foster private sector engagement, enhance ASEAN's ability to integrate
into global value chains, narrow the development gap, strengthen cooperation with ASEAN's
Dialogues Partners, and ensure effective monitoring and reporting of ASEAN's progress in
facilitating trade.

**II** **SCOPE**

5. In line with the ASEAN commitments to trade facilitation under the ATIGA and the AEC
Blueprint 2025, the scope of the ATFF shall cover the following areas: a) Customs and transport
facilitation; b) Transparency of trade regulation and procedures; c) Standards and
conformance; and d) Private sector engagement and business facilitation. Other
specific areas of ATFF, such as the ASEAN Single Window (ASW), the ASEAN Customs
and Transit System (ACTS), the ASEAN Trade Repository (ATR) with the inter-operative
network of National Trade Repositories (NTRs); the ASEAN-wide system of SelfCertification, the system of ASEAN Solutions for Investments, Services and Trade
(ASSIST), and/or the various initiatives to streamline Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) and
eliminate Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs), shall be coordinated and advanced by the specific
subsidiary bodies active in each of these focus areas under the coordination of the
ASEAN Trade Facilitation Joint Consultative Committee (ATF-JCC).

FINAL

**III** **OBJECTIVES**

6. The objectives of the ATFF shall be the following:

a) To achieve the competitive, efficient and seamless movement of goods within
the region in order to enhance ASEAN's trade and production networks, better
participate into global value chains, as well as to establish a highly integrated
and cohesive economy.
b) To minimise the impact of non-tariff measures (NTMs) and achieve the
elimination of non-tariff barriers (NTBs), fostering an effective and responsive
regional approach to efficiently address NTMs with a view to pursuing legitimate
policy objectives while reducing cost and time of doing business in ASEAN;

c) To further promote the active engagement of the private sector, with particular
emphasis on the development and promotion of micro, small and medium
enterprises (MSMEs) in the process of regional economic integration, through
greater participation of the various ASEAN business associations in the
appropriate _fora_ ;

d) To address the development gaps between and within AMSs and the need to
facilitate the increasing participation of all AMSs, especially least developed
AMSs, in the process of implementation of ASEAN trade facilitation
programmes;

e) To enhance the institutional coordination among the relevant sectoral bodies of
ASEAN, in order to effectively implement the trade facilitation measures under
their respective purview consistently with their sectoral work-plans for 20162025 and the _ASEAN Blueprint 2025_ ;

f) To improve the monitoring mechanism for the implementation of trade
facilitation measures, with a view to increasing their effectiveness and
responsiveness in improving the competitiveness of ASEAN industries and
businesses, particularly MSMEs; and

g) To encourage the implementation of trade facilitation measures, which have
been accepted by international institutions such as the WTO and/or the WCO,
and in light of other relevant best practices.

**IV** **PRINCIPLES**

7. A number of key principles shall guide the agenda of regional trade facilitation on the
basis of the ATFF and in line with the overarching rationale of trade facilitation under ATIGA
and AEC Blueprint 2025. These principles provide guidance and direction for the further
development and implementation of the ASEAN trade facilitation programme.

a) Transparency: Information on policies, laws, regulations, administrative rulings,
licensing, certification, qualification and registration requirements, technical
regulations, standards, guidelines, procedures and practices relating to trade in
goods (hereinafter referred to as " _rules and procedures relating to trade_ ") shall
be made available to all interested parties, consistently and in a timely manner,
at no cost or a reasonable cost;

FINAL

b) Communications and consultations: AMSs shall endeavour to facilitate and
promote effective mechanisms for exchanges with the business and trading
community, including opportunities for consultation when formulating,
implementing and reviewing rules and procedures relating to trade;

c) Simplification and efficiency: AMSs shall simplify the rules and procedures
relating to trade, by fostering responsive regulatory/good regulatory practices,
in order to reduce burdensome, restrictive or unnecessary measures;

d) Non-discrimination: AMSs shall apply the rules and procedures relating to trade
in a non-discriminatory manner and based on market principles;

e) Consistency and predictability: AMSs shall apply rules and procedures relating to
trade in a consistent, predictable and uniform manner, so as to minimise
uncertainty. Rules and procedures relating to trade shall be applied in a nondiscretionary manner and shall provide clear and precise procedural guidance to
the appropriate authorities with standard policies and operating procedures;

f) Harmonisation and mutual recognition: While maintaining the right to regulate
or set rules to pursue legitimate objectives such as the protection of health,
safety or public morals and the conservation of exhaustible natural resources,
the regulations, rules and procedures affecting the acceptance of goods
between AMSs shall be harmonised subject to domestic regulation on the basis
of international standards and facilitated through mutual recognition, where
appropriate;

g) Modernisation and use of new technology: AMSs will review and update, if
necessary, the rules and procedures relating to trade, including new information
and new business practices, and based on the adoption, where appropriate, of
modern techniques and new technology;

h) Due process: Access to adequate legal appeal procedures, which add greater
certainty to trade transactions, shall be provided by AMSs in accordance with
the applicable laws of the respective AMS;

i) Cooperation: AMSs shall strive to work closely with the private sector in the
introduction of measures conducive to trade facilitation, including by open
channels of communication and cooperation between both governments and
business; and

j) Private sector orientation: AMSs shall endeavour to engage the business sector
and community-based organisations even more effectively, both in terms of
providing easier access to official information on implementation and by
obtaining timely feedback on policies or measures being proposed, particularly
when they have a trade facilitation goal.

**V** **INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK**

8. In order to realize the objectives of the ATFF, the _ASEAN Trade Facilitation Joint_
_Consultative Committee_ (ATF-JCC) shall be revived to carry out its mandate, consistently with
the agreed scope of the _AEC Blueprint 2025_ and the ATIGA:
