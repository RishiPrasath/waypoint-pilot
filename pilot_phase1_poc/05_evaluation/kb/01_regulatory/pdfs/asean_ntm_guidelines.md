**Guidelines for the Implementation of**
**ASEAN Commitments on Non-Tariff Measures on Goods**

**I.** **PREAMBLE**

1. In accordance with the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) including its Notes and Supplementary
Provisions contained in Annex 1A to the Agreement Establishing the World Trade
Organization (WTO Agreement), [1] the **Guidelines for the Implementation of ASEAN**
**Commitments on Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) on Goods** (hereinafter referred to as the
**Guidelines** ) are hereby adopted. The Guidelines shall not add to, alter, or constitute any
reinterpretation of the rights and obligations of ASEAN Member States as stipulated in the
ATIGA and in the WTO/GATT 1994.

2. The Guidelines:

a) **Adhere to** the objectives and principles of the ASEAN Trade Facilitation

Framework, the Good Regulatory Practice (GRP) Work Plan, and the GRP Core
Principles;

b) **Recognise** the relevant action lines in the AEC 2025 Trade Facilitation Strategic

Action Plan (ATF-SAP) and the AEC 2025 Strategic Action Plan for Trade in Goods
(SAP-TIG); and,

c) **Incorporate** the key NTM elements recommended in the Discussion Paper on

NTMs/Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs), drafted by the Coordinating Committee on the
Implementation of ATIGA (CCA) and the recommendations of the 32 [nd] High Level
Task Force on Economic Integration (HLTF-EI) on NTMs and NTBs.

**II.** **OBJECTIVES**

3. In accordance with the ATIGA and the WTO rights and obligations, the Guidelines
provide a general framework to:

a) Improve the transparency and management of NTMs in ASEAN; and,

b) Minimise the trade-distortive effects of NTMs, while allowing ASEAN Member

States to pursue legitimate policy objectives.

1 For the purposes of the Guidelines, the relevant agreements in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement include, but
are not limited to, the Agreement on Agriculture, the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, the Agreement on Trade-Related
Investment Measures, the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade 1994, the Agreement on Preshipment Inspection, the Agreement on Rules of Origin, the Agreement

**III.** **SCOPE**

4. The Guidelines are intended to operationalise the following ATIGA elements: Article
11 (Notification Procedures); Article 12 (Publication and Administration of Trade
Regulations); Article 13 (ASEAN Trade Repository); Article 40 (Application of Non-Tariff
Measures); and, Article 42 (Elimination of Other Non-Tariff Barriers).

5. For the purposes of Article 44 (Import Licensing Procedures) of the ATIGA, the
Guidelines for the Implementation of Import Licensing Procedures in ASEAN (ILP
Guidelines), adopted on 3 August 2011, shall be incorporated into the Guidelines, _mutatis_
_mutandis_ .

6. For the purposes of the Guidelines, NTMs comprise trade rules, regulations or
specific measures attributable to the relevant levels of legal instruments maintained by an
ASEAN Member State. Such legal instruments may include: governmental regulations,
executive directives, ministerial and sub-ministerial regulations/directives/circulars, and any
other implementing regulations, including administrative, technical, and operational
procedures, and their manner of implementation.

**IV.** **DEFINITIONS**

7. **NTMs**, as defined by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), are policy measures other than customs tariffs that can potentially have an
economic effect on international trade in goods, changing quantities traded, or prices or
both.

8. **NTBs**, as defined by the ATIGA, are measures other than tariffs, which effectively
prohibit or restrict imports or exports of goods within Member States.

**V.** **PERMISSIBLE NTMs**

9. As specified in Article 40 of the ATIGA, Member States shall not adopt or maintain
any NTMs on the importation of any good of any other Member States or on the
exportation of any good destined for the territory of any other Member States, except in
accordance with its WTO rights and obligations or in accordance with the ATIGA.

10. In line with Paragraph 9, Member States may adopt or maintain NTMs, as provided
for under the ATIGA and GATT 1994 provisions, including, but not limited to:

a) Article 8 (General Exceptions), Article 9 (Security Exceptions), Article 10

(Measures to Safeguard the Balance-of-Payments), Article 24 (Special Treatment
on Rice and Sugar), Paragraph 7 of Article 42 (Elimination of Other Non-Tariff
Barriers), Article 44 (Import Licensing Procedures), and the relevant articles in
Chapter 6 (Customs), Chapter 7 (Standards, Technical Regulations and
Conformity Assessment Procedures), and Chapter 8 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures), of the ATIGA; and,

b) Paragraph 2 of Article XI (General Elimination of Quantitative Restrictions),

Article XII (Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments), Article XX
(General Exceptions), and Article XXI (Security Exceptions), of the GATT 1994, and
the relevant provisions in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement. [2]

**VI.** **GUIDING PRINCIPLES**

11. Member States shall ensure that NTMs conform to the following main principles:
_necessity and proportionality_, _consultations and engagement_, _transparency_, _non-_
_discrimination and impartiality_, and _periodic review_ .

12. In this regard, Member States shall also take into consideration the need to adhere
to the ASEAN Good Regulatory Practice Core Principles, which comprise: (i) Clarity in policy
rationale, objectives, and institutional frameworks; (ii) Produce benefits that justify costs
and be least distortive to the markets; (iii) Be consistent, transparent, and practical; (iv)
Support regional regulatory cooperation; (v) Promote stakeholder engagement and
participation; and (vi) Be subject to regular review for continued relevance, efficiency, and
effectiveness.

**VII.** **IMPLEMENTING ASEAN NTM COMMITMENTS AND THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES**

_**Principle 1: Necessity and proportionality**_

13. Member States shall ensure that NTMs are not more restrictive than necessary in
fulfilling their legitimate public policy objectives and shall consider their proportionality in
addressing public risks or market externalities. In accordance with Article 40 of the ATIGA,
trade measures shall not create unnecessary obstacles to trade.

14. In ensuring that a particular NTM is necessary and proportional, the Member State
preparing the measure shall endeavour to conduct an ex-ante regulatory review process,
based on the Regulatory Impact Assessment methodology or similar approaches. The review
process should identify:

a) Whether there are potential barrier effects of the proposed NTM to the extent

that it will reduce imports from other Member States or increase the costs of
compliance by exporters of other Member States, to the advantage of traders,
manufacturers, or other parties in the issuing Member State or in any other
Member State;

2 For the purposes of this paragraph, the relevant provisions in Annex 1A to the WTO Agreement may include,
but are not limited to, the Understanding on Balance of Payments Provisions of GATT 1994; Article 2 (Basic
Rights and Obligations) of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; Article
2.2 (Preparation, Adoption and Application of Technical Regulations by Central Government Bodies) of the
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade; the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures; and Article 8
(Identification of Non-Actionable Subsidies) of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.

b) Implementation arrangements of the proposed NTM, which may include:

administrative and institutional issues, mechanisms for enforcement, monitoring
and evaluation, information and publication requirements, and compliance costs;
and,

c) Alternative regulatory and non-regulatory options, that are economically and

technically feasible, and ATIGA/WTO-consistent, which would achieve the same
legitimate objectives as the originally proposed NTM.

15. In implementing Paragraph 14, Member States may wish to strengthen their
respective National Trade Facilitation Committees (NTFCs) to include regulatory oversight
functions in reviewing newly introduced and existing NTMs and undertaking coordination on
NTM notifications and private sector engagement. The absence of an NTFC shall not limit
the work on NTM review. The establishment of national NTM or ATF-JCC focal point/s could
be considered in undertaking the coordination, either under the NTFCs or as a separate
body.

_**Principle 2: Consultations and engagement**_

16. In preparing an NTM, Member States shall seek to provide adequate opportunity
and timeframe for the relevant private sector and civil society organisations and interested
persons in the issuing Member State and other Member States, to comment on the
proposed draft NTM.

17. Member States, in conducting domestic public consultations, shall endeavour to:

a) Undertake timely consultations with the affected stakeholders, prior to the

adoption of NTMs;

b) Publish proposed or amended NTMs, including results of ex-ante regulatory

impact analyses; and,

c) Clearly establish and publish the procedures by which the relevant stakeholders

may submit comments.

18. In consulting and engaging with the private sector and interested persons in other
Member States, the issuing Member State may wish to refer to the Rules of Procedures for
Private Sector Engagement under the ASEAN Economic Community, as endorsed at the 23 [rd]
ASEAN Economic Ministers' Retreat in March 2017.

_**Principle 3: Transparency**_

19. The preparation, adoption, and application of NTMs shall be transparent and clear to
the public and to other Member States. Member States shall seek to notify the NTMs,
before their adoption, to ASEAN to allow for comments by other Member States.

20. Member States, in introducing or amending NTMs or other trade measures, shall
seek to provide advance notifications to the Senior Economic Officials' Meeting (SEOM) and
the ASEAN Secretariat. In compliance with Article 11 of the ATIGA, the notifications shall:

a) Be provided 60 days before the action or measure is to take effect;

b) Provide an adequate opportunity for prior discussions with other Member States,

before the adoption of the action or measure; and,

c) Contain description, rationale, and implementation date and duration of the

NTM action or measure.

21. In providing the advance notifications to ASEAN, Member States shall extend their
respective WTO notifications to the SEOM through the ASEAN Secretariat, for compilation.
The ASEAN Secretariat shall provide copies of the notifications to the ASEAN Trade
Facilitation Joint Consultative Committee (ATF-JCC) and the CCA for information and
reference, and to the relevant ASEAN bodies for appropriate actions.

22. Under urgent or emergency circumstances, in which provisional public safety,
security and protection measures are considered necessary, and in accordance with the
relevant ATIGA or WTO obligations, [3] in lieu of the requirements stipulated in Paragraphs 20
and 21, a Member State shall endeavour to immediately notify the ASEAN Secretariat with
an overview of the NTM, including the products covered and impacted, the objective and
rationale of the measure, and the nature of the circumstances.

23. Should an issuing Member State not be able to comply with the above notification
procedures, other Member States may notify the relevant ASEAN bodies and the ASEAN
Secretariat of the NTM being introduced or amended by the issuing Member State.

24. In implementing Articles 12, 13 and 40 of the ATIGA, and in accordance with Article X
of GATT 1994, Member States shall ensure that their advance notifications of proposed
NTMs and the adopted and enforced NTMs and national trade and customs laws and rules,
are made available on their respective National Trade Repositories (NTRs) and properly
linked to the ASEAN Trade Repository (ATR). The published notifications and NTMs should
be categorised and classified according to the UNCTAD NTM Classification. [4]

_**Principle 4: Non-discrimination and impartiality**_

3 For the purposes of this paragraph, the relevant ATIGA and WTO obligations may include, but are not limited
to, Article 83 (Notification under Emergency Situation) of the ATIGA, Paragraph 6 of Annex B (Transparency of
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Regulations) of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures, and Paragraph 2.10 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.
4 To ensure consistency, Member States may wish to cross-reference the notifications and NTMs in their
respective NTRs and ATR with the notifications published in the Integrated Trade Intelligence Portal (I-TIP) of
the WTO.

25. NTMs shall be applied to products from other Member States and third countries in
a manner no less favourable than that accorded to like products of national origin.

26. In accordance with Article 42, Paragraphs 4 and 5, of the ATIGA, the CCA, in
consultation with the relevant ASEAN bodies, shall review any NTM notified or reported by
any other Member State or by the private sector to determine whether the measure results
in trade-distorting effects and constitutes an NTB, in which case the NTM will be subject to
removal by the corresponding Member State. The CCA shall take into consideration cases
submitted by the private sector through the ASEAN Solution for Investment, Services, and
Trade (ASSIST) and/or other ASEAN bodies.

27. In determining whether any notified or reported NTM constitutes an NTB, and for
the purposes of verification, assessment, and consultations, the respective Member States,
the CCA, and the relevant ASEAN bodies, may wish to consider the following criteria:

a) Whether the NTM complies with the relevant ATIGA or WTO obligations;

b) Whether the NTM is applied equally to domestic and imported products;

c) Whether the NTM has any restrictive, distortive, or discriminative trade impact

on other Member States or third countries; and,

d) Whether the NTM addresses any market failure. [5]

28. The Guidelines for the Matrix of Actual Cases on NTMs/NTBs (MAC Guidelines) shall
apply in addressing, resolving, and removing identified NTBs.

_**Principle 5: Periodic review**_

29. Member States shall endeavour to periodically review their NTMs to ensure that
NTMs: (i) met or contributed to the intended policy objectives; (ii) remain relevant to the
public interests being addressed; and, (iii) minimise/eliminate the trade-distortive effect.

30. For this purpose, Member States may wish to undertake periodic, ex-post reviews of
the respective NTMs through Regulatory Impact Assessments or similar approaches.

**VIII.** **IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENT FOR THE GUIDELINES**

31. Member States shall endeavour to implement the Guidelines by further
strengthening their national institutions, including by considering the establishment of a
national NTM focal point or a similar organisation [6] that would be responsible to undertake:

5 For the purposes of the Guidelines, "market failure," as defined by the World Bank, is a situation whose
outcome is sub-optimal from a collective point of view.
6 To ensure efficiency and effectiveness, Member States may wish to consider establishing the national NTM
committee or working group as part of the NTFCs or as a separate body, and assigning it with clear mandate
and organisational structure.

(i) ex-ante NTM reviews; (ii) public consultations and private sector engagement; (iii)
internal coordination on notification and publication of NTMs; (iv) the removal of NTBs or
barrier elements of NTMs; and, (v) ex-post regulatory impact analyses.

32. The Guidelines will be implemented, in accordance with the relevant articles of the
ATIGA, as stipulated in Paragraph 4 of these Guidelines, by the relevant ASEAN bodies and
the Member States.

33. The implementation of the Guidelines shall be periodically reviewed and monitored
by the AFTA Council, through the ATF-JCC.
