## Quick Reference: Singapore Context

### GST Calculation Base by Incoterm

| Term | Add to Invoice for GST Base |
|------|---------------------------|
| EXW | + Freight + Insurance + All costs to SG |
| FCA | + Freight + Insurance |
| FOB | + Freight + Insurance |
| CFR | + Insurance |
| CIF | Nothing (already includes I&F) |
| CPT | + Insurance |
| CIP | Nothing (already includes I&F) |
| DAP | Verify what's included |
| DDP | N/A (duties already paid) |

**Formula**: GST = 9% × CIF Value
