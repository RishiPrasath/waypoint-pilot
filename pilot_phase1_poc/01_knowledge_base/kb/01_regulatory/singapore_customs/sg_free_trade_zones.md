# Singapore Free Trade Zones (FTZ)

## Overview

Free Trade Zones (FTZs) in Singapore serve to facilitate entrepot trade and transhipment activities. FTZs are designated areas where goods may be stored, handled, manufactured, or reconfigured without being subject to customs duties.

## Purpose and Function

All goods arriving by sea or air must initially be deposited in an FTZ, unless alternative arrangements with approved Customs premises (such as licensed warehouses) are made.

## Key Benefits

### Tax Suspension
Duty and GST are suspended for goods stored within the FTZ, and are only payable when the goods:
- Are consumed locally within the zone, OR
- Leave the FTZ and enter customs territory for domestic sales/consumption

### Trade Facilitation
