# Singapore HS Classification Guide

## What is the Harmonised System (HS)?

The Harmonised System is an international nomenclature (at 6-digit level) developed by the World Customs Organisation (WCO) for categorizing traded goods globally. It provides a standardized system for classifying merchandise in international trade.

## Structure of HS Codes

### Hierarchical Organization

The system organizes merchandise through:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Sections | 21 broad categories |
| Chapters | 97 product groupings |
| Headings | 4-digit codes |
| Subheadings | 6-digit codes (international standard) |

### Supporting Elements
- Section and Chapter Notes with subheading notes
- Systematically ordered headings divided into subheadings
- General Interpretative Rules (GIR)

### Arrangement Principle
Products are arranged in order of their degree of manufacture, both across sections and within individual chapters (from raw materials to finished goods).

## HS Code Digit Structure

| Digits | Level | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 2 digits | Chapter | 87 - Vehicles |
| 4 digits | Heading | 8703 - Motor vehicles for transport of persons |
| 6 digits | Subheading (International) | 8703.21 - Spark ignition, ≤1000cc |
| 8 digits | AHTN (ASEAN) | 8703.21.11 - CBU, new |
| 10 digits | National (Singapore) | 8703.21.11.00 - Specific national use |

## ASEAN Harmonised Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN)

The ASEAN Harmonised Tariff Nomenclature extends HS to 8 digits, ensuring consistent classification across member states.

**Current version**: AHTN 2022, incorporating all WCO amendments.

This ensures uniform product classification for:
- ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)
- Preferential tariff application
- Trade statistics

## Classification Process

The standard approach involves sequentially determining the correct classification level:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Determine 4-digit heading** (primary category)
2. **Identify 1-dash subheading** (first refinement)
3. **Narrow to 2-dash subheading** (further specificity)
4. **Continue to lower levels** as needed

**Critical Rule**: Do not proceed directly to the lower-level subheadings without first determining the appropriate heading.

## General Interpretative Rules (GIR)

The GIR provide structured guidance for uniform classification interpretation and must be applied in sequential order.

### The Six Rules

| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Rule 1 | Classification by terms of headings and section/chapter notes |
| Rule 2 | (a) Incomplete/unfinished goods; (b) Mixtures and combinations |
| Rule 3 | (a) Most specific heading; (b) Essential character; (c) Last in numerical order |
| Rule 4 | Most akin goods |
| Rule 5 | (a) Cases and containers; (b) Packing materials |
| Rule 6 | Classification at subheading level |

## Requesting a Classification Ruling

For complex or uncertain classifications, apply for an official ruling from Singapore Customs.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Fee | S$75 per product |
| Validity | As stated in ruling |
| Binding | Yes, for the applicant |

### When to Request a Ruling
- New or unfamiliar products
- Products with multiple possible classifications
- High-value imports where duty rates vary significantly
- Products on controlled lists

## Common Classification Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Multi-function products | Devices serving multiple purposes |
| Composite goods | Products made of multiple materials |
| Sets | Collections of goods sold together |
| Parts and accessories | Determining if classified with main product |
| Technology products | Rapid innovation creates ambiguity |

## Learning Resources

Singapore Customs offers various resources:
- **SC102 Course**: Comprehensive HS classification training
- **Downloadable guides**: Reference materials
- **MCQ modules**: Covering 30+ HS chapters for self-study

## Key Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| HS/CA Product Code Search | Find applicable codes |
| TradeNet | Declare goods with correct codes |
| Singapore Trade Classification, Customs & Excise Duties (STCCED) | Official classification reference |

## Compliance

### Importance of Correct Classification
- Determines duty rates payable
- Identifies controlled goods requiring permits
- Affects trade statistics
- Incorrect classification may result in penalties

### Penalties for Mis-classification
- Under-declaration of duties
- Delayed clearance
- Potential prosecution for false declarations
