## RVC Calculation Principles (Annex 5)

When using the Regional Value Content (RVC) method to determine origin, the following principles apply:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Materiality | All costs material to origin evaluation must be included |
| Consistency | Costing allocation method must be consistent unless justified by commercial reality |
| Reliability | Costing information must be supported by appropriate documentation |
| Relevance | Costs must be allocated based on objective, quantifiable data |
| Accuracy | Methodology must accurately represent the cost element |
| GAAP Compliance | Must follow generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country; no double-counting |
| Currency | Use updated costing information from existing accounting records |

### Acceptable Costing Methods
- **Actual Costs**: All direct and indirect costs incurred in production
- **Projected/Budgeted Costs**: May be used with variance analysis as proof
- **Standard Costs**: Must provide evidence costs are used for accounting purposes
- **Average/Moving Average Costs**: Must justify basis and time period for calculation
- **Fixed Costs**: Must be apportioned according to sound cost accounting principles

## Tariff Line Elimination Status (2021 WTO Fact Sheet)

*Singapore maintains 100% tariff elimination — all 10,813 tariff lines at 0% duty under ATIGA.*

## Partial Cumulation Rules (Annex 6)

When a product does not fully meet the 40% RVC threshold in a single ASEAN member state, partial cumulation allows:

- A good is eligible for **partial cumulation** if at least **20% RVC** originates in the member state where working/processing takes place
- RVC is calculated per the standard formula in Article 29
- Goods exported under partial cumulation are **not eligible for preferential tariff** treatment in the importing member state
- Must be accompanied by a valid **Certificate of Origin (Form D)** prominently marked **"Partial Cumulation"**
- Verification procedures (retroactive check and verification visit) under Annex 8 apply

## ASEAN Trade Facilitation Framework (ATFF)

The ATFF provides a coordinated approach to trade facilitation across ASEAN, covering:

### Scope Areas
- **Customs and transport facilitation** — streamlined border procedures
- **Transparency of trade regulation and procedures** — publication and notification requirements
- **Standards and conformance** — harmonization and mutual recognition
- **Private sector engagement and business facilitation** — MSME support

### Key Instruments Under ATFF
| Instrument | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **ASEAN Single Window (ASW)** | Electronic exchange of trade documents (Form D, customs declarations) |
| **ASEAN Customs Transit System (ACTS)** | Single customs formality for goods crossing multiple ASEAN borders |
| **ASEAN Trade Repository (ATR)** | Central access point for trade regulations from all member states |
| **ASEAN-Wide Self-Certification (AWSC)** | Certified exporters self-certify origin without government-issued CO |
| **ASSIST** | Online platform for resolving trade and investment issues |
| **Non-Tariff Measures (NTM) Guidelines** | Framework for minimizing NTM impact while pursuing legitimate policy objectives |

### ATFF Guiding Principles
1. **Transparency** — Trade rules and procedures available to all, at no or reasonable cost
2. **Communications and consultations** — Effective mechanisms for business engagement
3. **Simplification and efficiency** — Reduce burdensome or unnecessary measures
4. **Non-discrimination** — Apply rules on market principles
5. **Harmonization and mutual recognition** — Align with international standards (WTO, WCO)
6. **Modernization and new technology** — Leverage digital tools
7. **Due process** — Fair and transparent decision-making
8. **Cooperation** — Regional and international collaboration
9. **Private sector orientation** — Business-focused facilitation

### Import Licensing in ASEAN
ASEAN member states follow Guidelines for Implementation of Import Licensing Procedures (ILP Guidelines), aligned with WTO ILA:
- **Automatic licensing**: Approval granted in all cases, no restricting effect on imports
- **Non-automatic licensing**: Requires specific conditions to be met before import approval
- Member states commit to transparency, non-discrimination, and peer review of licensing practices
