**AEO CODES**

AEO codes are issued to AEOs by their respective Customs
Administrations and are used to identify AEO cargoes.

In Singapore, our STP companies and STP-Plus companies are
issued with their unique AEO code (a 17-character alphanumeric in

#### Declare your AEO code in TradeNet import and/or export permit declarations so that your shipment could be identified domestically:

~~**Declaration Field in TradeNet             Information to be Declared**~~
~~Customs Procedure Code (CPC)                       AEO~~
Processing Code 1 (PC1)                               SG
Processing Code 2 (PC2)                         XXXXXXXXXXXX

For STP-Plus companies exporting to our MRA partners, you should also
provide your AEO code to your overseas importers, so that your AEO
code could be declared in their import declarations.

For STP-Plus companies exporting to Hong Kong SAR (HK) and New
Zealand (NZ), your AEO status would be automatically recognised when
your HK and NZ importers declare your company as the supplier in their
import declarations.

For STP-Plus companies exporting to United States (US), your AEO
status would be automatically recognised when your US importers use
your Manufacturer Identification (MID) number in their import
declarations.

Please contact your US importer to obtain the MID number issued to your company if you are not
aware of your MID number or it is your first shipment to the US; and inform your Account Manager
(from Singapore Customs) of the MID number.

# **DETAILED PROCEDURES**

**IF YOU ARE IMPORTING FROM AN MRA PARTNER'S AEO**

#### Obtain your business partner's AEO code and declare it in your TradeNet import permit declarations in the following manner:

~~**Declaration Field in TradeNet             Information to be Declared**~~

Customs Procedure Code (CPC)                       AEO
Processing Code 1 (PC1)                   Either AU, BN, CA, CN, GB, HK,
ID, JP, MY, NZ, KR, TH, TW or US
Processing Code 2 (PC2)                   AEO or MID (for US) number

TradeNet allows up to 5 entries under the PC1 and PC2 fields. STP-Plus
companies importing from an MRA partner's AEO exporter could
declare both their own AEO code and their business partner's AEO
code in their TradeNet permit declarations.
Please note that the Singapore AEO code declared in the Customs
Clearance Permit should only belong to either the importer, exporter or
freight forwarder for the particular shipment. Freight forwarders who
are providing only permit declaration services for any particular
shipment should not declare their Singapore AEO code in the Customs
Clearance Permit.
