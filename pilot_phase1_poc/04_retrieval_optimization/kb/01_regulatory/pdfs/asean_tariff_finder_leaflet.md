The ASEAN Tariff Finder is an online portal that
offers information on customs duties, taxes,
additional duties, related Rules of Origin as well
as import regulations of more than 160 destination

All nomenclatures in the ASEAN Tariff Finder are
available in English and reflect the currently applied
customs tariffs. You may either use product codes
based on the Harmonized System (HS), keywords,
free texts or the nomenclature tree view to find
out trade-related information such as customs
duties, Rules of Origin and import regulations of
destination countries. Although the first six digits
are based on the HS, the classi fication after the
sixth digit may vary according to regional or
national particularities.

tariff rates or even duty-free access of your product.

Specific Rules (PSRs) may vary with the different
Agreements. For the product codes chosen, the
ASEAN Tariff Finder will show the applied tariff
rates and relevant PSRs.
