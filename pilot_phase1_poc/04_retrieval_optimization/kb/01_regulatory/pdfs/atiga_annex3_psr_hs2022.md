**SUBSTANTIAL TRANSFORMATION CRITERION**

**FOR TEXTILES AND TEXTILE PRODUCTS**

1. Textile material or article shall be deemed to be originating in a Member State, when it has
undergone, prior to the importation to another Member State, any of the following:

i. Petrochemicals which have undergone the process of polymerization or
polycondensation or any chemicals or physical processes to form a polymer;

ii. Polymer which has undergone the process of melt spinning or extrusion to form a
synthetic fiber;

iii. Spinning fiber into yarn;

iv. Weaving, knitting or otherwise forming fabric;

v. Cutting fabric into parts and the assembly of those parts into a completed article;

vi. Dyeing of fabric, if it is accompanied by any finishing operation which has the effect
of rendering the dyed good directly;

vii. Printing of fabric, if it is accompanied by any finishing operation which has the effect
of rendering the printed good directly usable;

viii. Impregnation or coating when such treatment leads to the manufacture of a new
product falling within certain headings of customs tariffs;

ix. Embroidery which represents at least five percent of the total area of the
embroidered good.

2. Notwithstanding any provisions in Chapter 3 of this Agreement, an article or material shall
not be considered to be originating in the territory of a Member State by virtue of merely having
undergone any of the following:

i. Simple combining operations, labeling, pressing, cleaning or dry cleaning or
packaging operations, or any combination thereof;

ii. Cutting to length or width and hemming, stitching or overlocking fabrics which are
readily identifiable as being intended for a particular commercial use;

iii. Trimming and/or joining together by sewing, looping, linking, attaching of accessory
articles such as straps, bands, beads, cords, rings and eyelets;

iv. One or more finishing operations on yarns, fabrics or other textile articles, such as
bleaching, waterproofing, decating, shrinking, mercerizing, or similar operations; or

v. Dyeing or printing of fabrics or yarns.

3. The following items made of non-originating textile materials shall be considered as
originating good if it has undergone the processes identified in paragraph 1 but not merely performing
the processes identified in paragraph 2:

i. Handkerchiefs;
ii. Shawls, scarves, veils, and the like;
iii. Travelling rugs and blankets;
iv. Bed linen, pillow cases, table linen, toilet linen and kitchen linen;
v. Sacks and bags, of a kind used for packing of goods;
vi. Tarpaulins, awnings and sunblinds;
vii. Floor cloths, and dish cloths and other similar articles simply made up.

4. Notwithstanding the above paragraph, non-originating textile material covered in the list
stated below shall be deemed to be originating in a Members State if it satisfies the working or
processing set out therein.

5. The prefix "ex" used in front of the HS or AHTN code indicates that only a part of the
subheading concerned is subjected to the Textile List Rule.

**A.** **Fibres and yarns**
