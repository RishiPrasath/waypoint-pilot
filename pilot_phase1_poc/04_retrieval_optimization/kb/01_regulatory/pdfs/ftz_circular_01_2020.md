Circular No: 01/2020
21 Feb 2020

Traders and Declaring Agents

Dear Sir/Madam

**STORAGE OF DUTIABLE GOODS IN FREE TRADE ZONES & REPORTING**
**SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS**

Storage of Dutiable Goods in FTZ

Under Section 5(4) of the Free Trade Zones Act, dutiable goods namely liquors
and tobacco products as prescribed under the Free Trade Zones (Prescribed Goods)
Notification are not allowed to be stored in Free Trade Zones (FTZ).

2 To facilitate the quick turnaround for transhipment and encourage entrepot
trade, Singapore Customs has administratively allowed such dutiable goods to be
temporarily stored in FTZs **for a period of** **up to** **30 days,** pending transhipment or
removal to a licensed warehouse or licensed factory warehouse ("licensed
premises"). If longer term storage is required, such dutiable goods must be removed
from the FTZ into the licensed premises. Please note that failure to deposit such
dutiable goods in the licensed premises is an offence under Section 52(3) of the
Customs Act. There is no storage restriction on dutiable goods brought into FTZ
under "through" Bill of Lading or "through" Air WayBill. For more information on
transhipment, please visit www.customs.gov.sg - businesses > transhipping goods

- quick guide on transhipping goods.

3 Please also be reminded that under Section 39 of the Corruption, Drug
Trafficking and other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Cap 65A, all
persons have the legal obligation to file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) to
the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) if they know or have reasonable
grounds to suspect that any property is connected to criminal activity, in the course
of their trade, profession, business or employment.
