### **1. Singapore Origin Criteria under Non-Preferential Rules of Origin**

To qualify as goods of Singapore origin for non-preferential purposes (i.e. for goods that are not
seeking preferential tariff treatment), the following origin criteria apply:

a) Be wholly obtained (i.e. wholly grown or produced entirely in Singapore, refer to Annex I);

or

b) Have undergone substantial transformation in Singapore by meeting any of the following

criteria:

i) Manufactured in Singapore with minimum 25% of Local Content based on the ex
factory price of the finished goods;
ii) Attained a Change in Tariff Classification at the 6-digit level (i.e. Change in Tariff Sub
Heading); or
iii) Undergone a Chemical Reaction (only for products under HS Chapters 27 to 40).

Goods which have only undergone minimal processing in Singapore, as indicated in Annex II,
would not qualify as Singapore-originating.

For the purposes of Singapore's import, export and transhipment permit applications, the
"Country/Region of Origin" of a good refers to the country/region in which the goods were
wholly obtained or substantially transformed to their final form. To declare "Singapore" as the
"Country/Region of Origin" for goods that are not seeking preferential tariff treatment, the goods
must meet the above criteria.

Singapore's non-preferential origin criteria also apply to the issuance of ordinary (nonpreferential) Certificates of Origin, which you may wish to obtain for commercial reasons.

### **1.1. Local Content Rule**

The local content is calculated as follows:

Local Raw + Direct + Direct
Materials Labour Overhead
Cost Cost Cost
Local   = -------------------------------------------------------    X 100 = %
Content Ex-factory Price

### **1.2. Change in Tariff Classification Rule**

All foreign or undetermined raw materials used in production must undergo a Change in Tariff
Classification at Sub-Heading level (CTSH) of the Harmonized System Tariff Nomenclature
(HS).

A finished product that does not undergo CTSH shall nevertheless be considered as Singapore
origin if the value of all imported or non-originating materials used in its production that do
not undergo the required CTSH does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Ex-Factory price of
the finished product.

### **1.3. Chemical Reaction Rule**

For goods under HS Chapters 27 to 40 (mainly mineral fuels, chemicals, plastics and rubber
products), the Chemical Reaction rule may be applied to any good classified in these chapters.

The Chemical Reaction rule applies to processes (including a biochemical process) which result
in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new
intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.

The following are not considered to be Chemical Reactions for the purposes of this definition:

a) Dissolving in water or other solvents;
b) The elimination of solvents including solvent water; or
c) The addition or elimination of water of crystallization.

### **Annex I -- List of Wholly Obtained Products**

The following categories of products can qualify as wholly obtained (i.e. wholly grown or
produced entirely in Singapore) in a beneficiary country:

1. Mineral products extracted from its soil or from its sea bed;
2. Vegetable products harvested there;
3. Live animals born and raised there;
4. Products obtained there from live animals;
5. Products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;
6. Products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea by its vessels;
7. Products made on board its factory ships exclusively from the products referred to in para

(6) above;
8. Used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials;
9. Waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;
10. Products obtained there exclusively from the products specified in (1) to (9) above (such as

iron sheets, bars produced from iron ore, cotton fabrics woven from raw cotton, recovery
of lead from used motor-car batteries, recovery of metal from metal shavings).

### **Annex II -- List of Simple/Minimal Operations**

Products which have only undergone the following 'minimal processes' would not qualify as of
Singapore origin:

1. Operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during transport and

storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other
aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);
2. Simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying,

matching (including the making up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;
3. (i) Changes of packing and breaking up and assembly of consignments;

(ii) Simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, and all
other simple packing operations;
4. The affixing of marks, labels or other like distinguishing signs on products or their

packaging;
5. Simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds;
6. Simple assembly of parts of products to constitute a complete product;
7. A combination of two or more operations specified in (1) to (6);
8. Slaughter of animals.
