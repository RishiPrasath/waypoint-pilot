**ASEAN Fully Implement e-Form D through the ASEAN Single Window**

**Jakarta, 1 January 2024**

ASEAN Member States started fully implementing the issuance and acceptance of
e-Form D through the ASEAN Single Window (ASW) on 1 January 2024. From now
on, hard copies of Form D will only be issued and accepted when technical issues
are taken place.

The initiative is one of the Priority Economic Deliverables under Indonesia's ASEAN
2023 Chairmanship which aims to enhance the utilisation of the ASW as well as to
support the Bandar Seri Begawan Roadmap (BSBR) goal to leverage digital
transformation taking place in the region and contribute to the goal of ASEAN to
accelerate the region's economic recovery and digital transformation integration.
Through the deliverable, ASEAN continues to redouble its effort in facilitating the
seamless movement of goods within ASEAN to enhance intra-ASEAN trade and
production networks, as well as to establish a more unified market for its firms and
consumers. Particularly, it is a robust response to the strategic measures of
simplifying and strengthening the Implementation of the Rules of Origin (ROO),
bringing a business-friendly and trade-facilitative tool to benefit MSMEs to
encourage them to expand, upgrade, and deepen their linkages within the region.

With the full implementation of the e-Form D through the ASW, the time of
application and submission of Certificates of Origin Form D would be substantially
reduced, while the administrative costs of processing documents would be
minimized, e.g., the cost of purchasing forms would be neglected. In the meantime,
the authenticity of the Form D data would be secured to reduce the risks of
fraudulence. In addition, ASEAN customs authorities can now save more time for
verifying Form D.

ASEAN Member States will continue to forge a modern agreement to further
simplify the procedures for the implementation of rules of origin under the process
of negotiating the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) Upgrade.
