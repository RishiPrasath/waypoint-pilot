#### 1988-2018

# **THE** **HARMONIZED** **SYSTEM**
##### A universal language for international trade 30 Years On

## PREFACE

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

On this occasion of the Harmonized System's 30 [th]
Anniversary, the "Harmonized System Compendium

- 30 Years On" has been published, an updated
and expanded version of the existing "Customs
Compendium" to meet the needs of a new generation
of Customs.

The original "Customs Compendium" series was
published in 2006. It was created to address topics
arising directly out of issues, questions and concerns
raised by the Director Generals of Customs. The
intention of those reference documents was not
only to provide information and food for thought for
Customs administrations, but also for their partners
and the general public.

The WCO's 183 Member administrations together
process 98% of international trade and have
incomparable technical expertise and knowledge of
Customs matters related to the classification of goods.
The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding
System (HS) contributes to the harmonization of
Customs and trade procedures, and non-documentary
trade data interchange.

The objective of this publication is to provide
a comprehensive description of the essential instrument
which is the Harmonized System, encompassing its
inception, how it works, its amendment and updating
processes, and its application. This new volume is a
highly topical addition to the collection, as the latest
edition of the Harmonized System entered into force
on 1 January 2017.

Against that background, this publication constitutes
a useful work of reference and the WCO hopes that
you will find it of interest.

## INTRODUCTION

With over US$ 15 trillion worth of goods moving
around the world, how do you know what is crossing
your border?

This is the issue that the Harmonized Commodity
Description and Coding System (popularly known
as the Harmonized System or the HS) is designed to
address. It is a nomenclature which enables all physical
goods moving across borders to be assigned to a class
in a uniform manner all over the world.

Thanks to its versatile structure and multipurpose
nature, the HS is a true "language of international
trade". It is used, as of December 2018, as the basis for
Customs tariffs and for the compilation of international
trade statistics, by more than 200 economies and
Customs or Economic Unions (of which 157 are
Contracting Parties to the HS Convention).

The HS is one of the most successful instruments
developed by the World Customs Organization
(WCO) because it addresses a fundamental need of
governments: the ability to categorize what is being
traded. This enables both decisions on immediate
actions for specific goods (for example duty collections,
restrictions or controls) and the use of the collated
information to underpin economic and trade related
policies and planning.

Governments and businesses alike use the HS's
identification and coding of merchandise to facilitate
international trade and regulation. The HS is, therefore,
an important instrument not only for the WCO but also
for all institutions, public or private, involved in world
trade.

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

While the HS has many uses, its first and fundamental
purpose is the categorisation of goods so that
governments can assign and collect import duties and
taxes. The WCO has 183 Members (as of December
2018), approximately three quarters of which could be
characterized as developing or in transition to a market
economy. A large percentage of these Members
depend to an important extent on Customs duties for
their national revenues.

However, the HS is more than just a tool for creating
tariffs for duty collection. It is used within many
other areas of government regulation and business
practices, for example, rules of origin, monitoring of
controlled goods, internal taxes, freight tariffs, quota
controls and statistical reporting. The statistical data
it provides is developed into national and international
trade information that informs trade policy, economic
research and analysis, and corporate decisions.

Goods need to be properly classified to enable correct
revenue collection. In addition, accurate classification is
required to ensure that the use of the HS in regulating
trade and in providing the data for trade statistics and
policy is not compromised. The more accurate the
application of the HS, the more it serves the needs of
its users.

This serves to emphasize the importance of proper
application of the HS for day-to-day Customs work,
policy development and trade.

## HISTORY

Tariffs have probably been in existence for as long
as governments. However early tariffs were simple
lists of goods and the amount payable, usually by
consignment, quantity or as a percentage of value.

Such lists worked well when there were only a
relatively few, simply defined commodities and their
only use was revenue collection. However, over the
last century and a half, the range and complexity of
goods traded has grown well beyond what could have
been imagined by previous Customs administrations.
At the same time, the demand for detailed information
on trade, including on international trade patterns, has
grown with that expansion.

This need for information makes it unsurprising
that the convergence between statistical and tariff
nomenclatures has increased over time and that the
first attempts at an international tariff nomenclature
arose from statisticians.

During the nine International Statistical Congresses
that were held between 1853 and 1876, the idea was
elaborated that an international tariff was a necessary
prerequisite to any attempt at an international statistical

6 | World Customs Organization

nomenclature. This was also favoured by business. At
the International Commercial Congress in Paris in 1889
the question was put: "Would it not be in the interest
of all nations to adopt in their Customs tariffs and in
their official statistics comparable classifications and
uniform vocabularies?"

Although the extreme difficulty of constructing a
uniform vocabulary for goods was recognised, the
idea was firmly implanted and there were successive
attempts on national and international levels to
advance this aim.

In 1931, the League of Nations' "Sub-Committee
of Experts for the Unification of Customs Tariff
Nomenclature" completed its "Draft Customs
Nomenclature", commonly referred to as the Geneva
Nomenclature, and the document was opened for
comments from governments of member states. The
Geneva Nomenclature had 941 four-digit headings,
organised into 86 Chapters grouped into 21 Sections.
The comments were incorporated and a revised
version was issued in 1937. Unfortunately, the outbreak
of the Second World War prematurely halted work on
the widespread adoption of the Nomenclature.

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

**BRUSSELS CONVENTION ON NOMENCLATURE FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS**
**IN CUSTOMS TARIFFS**

The drive for economic reconstruction and the desire
for greater freedom of trade following the Second
World War renewed the emphasis on Customs tariffs,
and the need for an internationally recognized common
nomenclature once again became a priority.

It was natural that the work done from 1948 onwards by
the European Customs Union Study Group with a view
to preparing a common Customs tariff for use by all
participating countries should be based on the Geneva
Nomenclature. It was the only standard framework of its
kind available at that time. Nevertheless, considerable
amendments were made to the Geneva text, partly
to reflect technical progress and partly because of
shortcomings revealed by the experience of countries
that had already adopted Geneva-type tariffs.

In 1949, a preliminary draft containing headings and
subheadings that had been produced was issued. The
Study Group decided that the immediate need for a
common nomenclature must be satisfied. Irrespective
of the progress which might be made on the European
Customs Union project, the very valuable results
already attained in the field of nomenclature should be
turned to advantage. It was accordingly decided that
the headings of the preliminary draft Nomenclature
(other than the subheadings, which were left to the
initiative of individual countries), should be established
by a Convention.

It was this 1949 draft, which, rearranged, abridged and
simplified, became, on 15 December 1950, the Brussels
Convention on Nomenclature for the Classification of
Goods in Customs Tariffs. This Convention was opened
for signature at the same time as the Convention
establishing a Customs Co-operation Council and the
Convention on the Valuation of Goods for Customs
Purposes. It came into force on 11 September 1959,
following the adoption, on 1 July 1955, of a Protocol
of Amendment establishing a revised version of the
Nomenclature.

This Nomenclature was initially known as the
"Brussels (Tariff) Nomenclature" (BTN), but in 1974
it was renamed the "Customs Co-operation Council
Nomenclature" (CCCN), to avoid any confusion as to
the international organisation responsible.

The CCCN took the form of a systematic list of goods.
It comprised 1,241 headings (1,011 headings until 1987)
divided among 96 Chapters (99 Chapters until 1987),
themselves arranged in 21 Sections. Each heading was
identified by two groups of two digits each: the first
group represented the Chapter in which the heading
appeared, while the second indicated its position in
that Chapter.

The Nomenclature Convention made special provision
for the administration of the new instrument (the
Nomenclature Committee), and laid down a procedure
for its periodic updating. The CCCN was updated on 1
January 1965 (first three Recommendations), 1 January
1972, 1 January 1978 and 1 January 1988.

There is no doubt that these measures, which
represented a significant advance over the Geneva
Nomenclature, were instrumental in the success of the
new Convention.

Until 1987, fifty-two countries were Contracting Parties
to the Nomenclature Convention. In actual fact over 150
countries and territories used the CCC Nomenclature
as a basis for their Customs tariffs.

The CCC Nomenclature was supported by:

**•** Explanatory Notes which, although not part of
the 1950 Nomenclature Convention, constituted
the official interpretation of the Nomenclature as
approved by the Customs Co-operation Council;

**•** An Alphabetical Index listing all the goods referred
to or described in the Nomenclature and the
Explanatory Notes;

**•** A Compendium of Classification Opinions listing
all the Classification Opinions adopted by the CCC
as a result of the study of classification questions
which had been brought to its attention.

**INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE HARMONIZED COMMODITY DESCRIPTION AND CODING**
**SYSTEM**

In the late 1960's there was a growing awareness of
the need to further rationalize and harmonize trade
documentation data and, in particular, to harmonize the
designation and coding of countries, units of quantity,
modes of transport, transport handling requirements
and, not least, commodities. Many studies had shown
the immense costs involved for the public and private
sectors in maintaining different product classification
systems in different countries. Indeed, it had been
found that a commodity could be designated up to 17
times in the course of a single international transaction.

The development of automatic data transmission
techniques did, it is true, offer a solution to this
problem, but only if an internationally recognized
code was available for identifying the goods. While
it was recognized that the problem could not be
entirely eliminated, further harmonizing commodity
classification would alleviate the problem.

The focal point for these studies was the Economic
Commission for Europe, via its Working Party on
Facilitation of International Trade Procedures and
a Group of Experts on data requirements and
documentation.

8 | World Customs Organization

Early in 1970, representatives of the Customs Cooperation Council discussed these developments with
other international organizations and, at a meeting
of the Economic Commission for Europe, it was
agreed that the Council was the organization best
suited to sponsor a study of the problems related
to commodity description and coding. The Council
set up a Study Group to examine the possibility of
preparing a Harmonized Commodity Description
and Coding System capable of meeting the principal
requirements of Customs authorities, statisticians,
carriers and producers. In addition to the CCCN, the
Study Group examined the "Standard International
Trade Classification" (SITC) as a classification tool. The
SITC was intended to be used by governments for
their external trade statistics.

In its final Report, approved by the Council in May 1973,
the Study Group concluded that:

a) the development of a Harmonized Commodity
Description and Coding System was not only
feasible but essential in the longer-term interests
of the facilitation of international trade;

b) the System should be developed from the CCCN
and SITC (revised). However, the work done to
date demonstrated a need for some changes in
these two instruments, to bring them into step
with current trade conditions; in addition, it would
be advisable to modify some parts of the CCCN
to facilitate establishment of the Harmonized
Commodity Description and Coding System; of
course, after the System had been developed,
steps would have to be taken to ensure that it be
revised as necessary;

c) the CCCN would constitute the core of the
Harmonized System. It should continue to be
maintained under the provisions of the current
Convention, as a separate 4-digit entity;

d) during the development of the System, account
should be taken of existing nomenclatures and
commodity description systems which were
primarily representative of Customs, statistical and
transport requirements;

e) the System should be developed under the
auspices of the Customs Co-operation Council,
but an international/ interorganizational body
should be maintained in existence throughout the
development period to ensure that the needs of
all interests involved were fully taken into account
and to plan the implementation of the Harmonized
System.

When the Council approved the Study Group's Report,
it also set up a Harmonized System Committee to
prepare the Harmonized System, in accordance with
the guidelines laid down by the Study Group, and to
draft the text of the instrument under which it would be
implemented. In addition, it set up a special unit in the
Council's Secretariat, known as the Technical Team, to
serve the new Committee and to draft initial proposals
for the Harmonized System. The Deputy Secretary
General (and later an Assistant Secretary General)
of the Council was put in charge of the Technical
Team and became the Chairman of the Harmonized
System Committee. The Nomenclature Directorate of
the Council's Secretariat gave its full support to the
Technical Team.

As the principal objective of the Harmonized System
was to meet the needs of all those concerned with
world trade (Customs, international trade statistics,
transport), it was important that the Harmonized
System Committee set up by the Council to prepare

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

the System should be representative of all the interests
involved. Consequently, in addition to delegates from
the Customs administrations of various Council Member
States, the Committee included representatives of a
number of national or international organizations. In
carrying out the technical work involved, the Committee
was assisted by a Working Party, made up of members
of the Committee itself together with representatives
of other countries (some of them not Members of the
Council) and of other organizations.

The interest and support for this proposal resulted in
almost 60 countries and more than 20 international
and national organizations taking part in the activities
of the Harmonized System Committee and its Working
Party (with their proposals, comments on proposals
or participation in the decision making procedure).
Representatives of national administrations using
tariffs not based on the CCCN, together with the
United Nations Statistical Office, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO), the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC),
the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the
International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the
International Union of Railways (UIC) took part in the
development.

In accordance with the general principles established
by the Study Group, the Harmonized System not only
had to be developed from the CCCN and SITC, Rev.2
(which was correlated to the CCCN), but also took
account of a wide range of other classification systems.
These included tariff or statistical nomenclatures, some
of which were based on the CCCN (Customs Tariff of
Japan, Tariff Nomenclature for the Latin American
Free Trade Association (NABALALC), Nomenclature
of Goods for the External Trade Statistics of the
(European) Community and Statistics of Trade between
Member States (NIMEXE)), whilst others had been
developed independently (Customs Tariff of Canada,
Customs Tariff of the United States, "Import Commodity
Classification'' and "Export Commodity Classification"
(Canada), "Schedule B (Export)" (United States)). They
also considered transport nomenclatures such as the
International Union of Railways' Standard Commodity
Nomenclature (NUM), the International Air Transport
Association's "Worldwide Air Cargo Commodity
Classification'' (WACCC), the Freight Tariff of the
Association of West India Trans-Atlantic Steamship
Lines (WIFT) and the "Standard Transportation
Commodity Code" (STCC).

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

The revision and amendment of the CCCN itself being
within the specific competence of the Nomenclature
Committee, established by the Nomenclature
Convention of 1950, the new texts relating to
heading level resulted from the final agreement
between both the Harmonized System Committee
and the Nomenclature Committee. Both Committees
worked in harmony. This enabled the Harmonized
System Committee to make use of the Nomenclature
Committee's subordinate bodies, notably the Chemists'
Committee, which provided useful advice.

The separate identification in the Harmonized System
of goods or groups of goods was, as a general rule,
approved only if there was agreement amongst
participants that the goods or groups of goods
concerned gave rise to significant international trade.

By adopting a strictly disciplined approach to the
task, the Harmonized System Committee was able to
complete preparatory work on the entire System by
the beginning of 1981. Only then did the true nature of
the System begin to reveal itself with its full importance
and implications. While in some respects it might be
regarded, as has been pointed out, as an offshoot of
the present CCCN and of the SITC, Rev.2, it was in fact
a new-generation, multipurpose, 6-digit nomenclature
for transportable goods. As such, in due time it would
replace the CCCN internationally, and the necessary
provisions had to be made, namely, the drafting of an
international Convention for the Harmonized System
and the undertaking of complementary measures in
related fields.

In May 1983, the Harmonized System Committee
and its Working Party held their 31 [st] and last Session.
During the third week the session was held jointly with
the Nomenclature Committee in order to finalize on
agreed terms all remaining technical issues of legal
standing common to both Committees.

The exploratory studies and preparatory work carried
out under the auspices of the Council resulted, some
13 years after commencement, in the completion of
the "Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding
System", and the establishment of a new international
Convention for its implementation.

In June 1983, during its 61 [st] /62 [nd] Sessions held in
Brussels, the Customs Co-operation Council approved
the Harmonized System Committee's draft International
Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description
and Coding System and opened it for signature. It also
approved the remaining proposals of the Committee.

The original intention of the Council was to implement
the Harmonized System Convention on 1 January
1987, and Article 13 was drafted accordingly. However,
delays in administrative measures and in GATT Article
XXVIII negotiations, necessitated by the transposition
of national tariffs to the format of the Harmonized
System, forced the Council to abandon the January
1987 date, and a new target date for implementation
was fixed for 1 January 1988.

The Harmonized System Convention, as amended,
entered into force on 1 January 1988.

## THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE HARMONIZED COMMODITY DESCRIPTION AND CODING SYSTEM

The Harmonized System Convention entered into force
on 1 January 1988. The objectives of the HS Convention
are, by harmonizing the description, classification and
coding of goods in international trade, to facilitate
international trade and the collection, comparison and
analysis of statistics. In addition, it is intended to reduce
the expense of trade and facilitate the standardization
of trade documentation and transmission of data.

The HS Convention comprises a Preamble, 20 Articles
and an Annex. The Preamble sets out why the
international community supported the adoption of the
HS. The 20 Articles include provisions for obligations
of Contracting Parties, role of the Council and the
Harmonized System Committee, settlement of disputes
between Contracting Parties, and the amendment
procedure. And the Annex is the Nomenclature for the
actual classification of commodities.

Contracting Parties are obliged to ensure that their
Customs tariffs and statistical nomenclatures for
both imports and exports are in conformity with the
Harmonized System. They should also make publicly
available their import and export trade statistics in
conformity with the six-digit codes of the Harmonized
System, or on their initiative, beyond that level.

14 | World Customs Organization

After its implementation, the use of the HS quickly
spread and there are now more than 200 economies
and Customs or Economic Unions currently using the
System as a basis for their national Customs tariffs.
However, its use is not confined to Customs tariffs. It is
also used for many other purposes. Among the most
important uses of the HS are the following:

**•** As a basis for Customs tariffs;

**•** As a basis for the collection of international trade
statistics;

**•** As a basis for rules of origin;

**•** For the collection of internal taxes;

**•** As a basis for trade negotiations (e.g., the WTO
schedules of tariff concessions, Free Trade
Agreements);

**•** For transport tariffs and statistics;

**•** For the monitoring of controlled goods (e.g.,
wastes, narcotics, chemical weapons, ozone layer
depleting substances, endangered species);

**•** As a vital element of core Customs process areas
of Customs controls and procedures, including
risk assessment, information technology and
compliance.

The use of the HS for monitoring and control of certain
goods covered by other international conventions or
agreements has greatly expanded. At the request of
several United Nations organizations, the WCO has
adopted Recommendations and HS subheadings to
monitor trade in controlled drugs and certain drug
precursors, chemical weapons, and environmentally
hazardous substances, which are covered by other
international conventions or agreements, as below
(not necessarily exhaustive):

**•** Single Convention on narcotic drugs (1961),
as amended by the 1972 Protocol

**•** Convention on psychotropic substances (1971)

**•** Convention against illicit traffic in narcotics drugs
and psychotropic substances (1988)

**•** Convention on international trade in endangered
species of wild fauna and flora

**•** Montreal Protocol relating to substances affecting
the ozone layer

**•** Basel Convention on the control of transboundary
movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal

**•** Convention on the prohibition of the development,
production, stockpiling and use of chemical
weapons and on their destruction

**•** OECD Council decision green and amber control
procedures

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

**•** WTO Agreement on trade in civil aircraft

**•** WTO Instrument on pharmaceutical products

**•** Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed
consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals
and pesticides in international trade

**•** Stockholm Convention on persistent organic
pollutants.

All WCO Members are eligible to accede to the
HS Convention, without any extra cost, and enjoy
numerous benefits. These include:

**•** automatic membership of the HS Committee with
the rights, opportunities and privileges of being
able to:

    - place questions on the Committee's agenda;

   - request an amendment to the Harmonized
System;

    - defend their interests in questions considered
by the Committee;

    - participate in the decision making process;
and

    - vote on decisions and amendments.

**•** the capacity to enter a reservation in respect of a
Committee decision and to veto any amendment if
it is unacceptable to them.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE HS

18 | World Customs Organization

**INTRODUCTION**

The Harmonized System is a structured nomenclature
comprising a series of 4-digit headings, most of which
are further subdivided into 5- and 6-digit subheadings.
Indeed, this structure reflects the manner in which the
System was developed: first by the deliberate creation
of 4-digit headings to accommodate particular
groupings of related products, and second, by the
subdivision of these headings to provide separate
treatment for the more important trade products
included in the headings. At the same time, care was
taken to ensure that the total scope of all related
subheadings, taken together, was exactly the same
as that for the relevant subheading or heading at the
immediately higher level.

Both in concept and design, the HS therefore represents
a valuable instrument, which may be used for a variety
of purposes while yet retaining a structure such as is
required for the purpose of tariff classification.

**MULTIPURPOSE NOMENCLATURE**

The HS was designed and developed as a "core"
system so that countries and organizations adopting it
could make further subdivisions (national subdivisions)
according to their particular needs. Customs tariffs and
statistical nomenclatures for the import and export of
goods can, today, be readily based at the national
level on this instrument. It can be used by Customs
administrations, statisticians, transporters, freighters,
etc. Its 6-digit code numbers can enable the collection
of data by grouping information at the subheading
levels.

As a multipurpose classification system, the HS is
designed to be usable for all transportable goods,
even if such goods are not actually involved in
international trade. However, to be truly multipurpose,
there needs to be flexibility to single out particular
products or subgroups of products as the need arises
internationally. To enable this flexibility, the HS includes
5- and 6-digit subheadings, under 4-digit headings.
These enable changes to be made to separately
identify products within a heading without moving the
products out of their groups.

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

An example will clarify this point. On the one hand, 4-digit heading 08.08, taken
in its entirety, covers apples, pears and quinces, fresh while heading 08.13 covers
dried fruit, etc. For various reasons, information may be required on both fresh
and dried apples. At the 4-digit level such information is not available, as headings
08.08 and 08.13 cover a number of other fruits. However, at subheading level, the
required information can easily be obtained by simply grouping the available data
from subheadings 0808.10 and 0813.30.

While this example relates to a relatively simple situation, it clearly shows that it is
only the groups coded at 5 or 6-digit subheading level which are fully multipurpose,
because they constitute "building blocks" which can be combined in different ways
to fulfil different needs. If the System is abridged to a uniform higher level of detail,
the resulting nomenclature ceases to fulfil a multipurpose function.

**STRUCTURED NOMENCLATURE**

For the purposes of tariff classification, the Harmonized System provides a legal and
logical structure within which a total of 1,222 headings (HS 2017) are grouped in 96
Chapters, the latter being themselves arranged in 21 Sections.

Each heading of the System is identified by a 4-digit code (column entitled "Heading"),
the first two digits of which indicate the Chapter wherein the heading appears,
while the latter two digits indicate the position of the heading in the Chapter. Thus,
heading 21.05 ("Ice cream and other edible ice, whether or not containing cocoa")
is the fifth heading in Chapter 21 which, in its entirety, covers "Miscellaneous edible
preparations". Most of the headings are subdivided into 5-digit (one-dash) and
6-digit (two-dash) subheadings.

World Customs Organization | 19

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

Thus, the Harmonized System 2017 comprises a total of 5387 separate groups of
goods identified by a 6-digit code (column entitled "HS code"), the first four digits
of which correspond to the relevant heading number, while the fifth and sixth digits
identify the one- and two-dash subheadings respectively (the absence of such
subheadings being indicated by a zero).

- The HS code for cucumbers and gherkins, fresh or chilled, is 0707.00, which
indicates that heading 07.07 has not been subdivided (fifth and sixth digits = 0);

- The HS code for buckwheat is 1008.10, which means that buckwheat is included
in the first one dash subheading (fifth digit = 1) of heading 10.08 and that this
subheading has not been further subdivided (sixth digit = 0);

- Potato starch is coded 1108.13, i.e., this product falls in the third two-dash
subheading (sixth digit = 3) of the first one-dash subheading (fifth digit = 1) of
heading 11.08.

The Harmonized System therefore constitutes a coherent set of headings and
subheadings, which, together with the General Interpretative Rules and Section,
Chapter and Subheading Notes, provide for the systematic and uniform classification
of goods.

The Harmonized System comprises:

- General Rules for the interpretation of the Harmonized System;

- Section and Chapter Notes, including Subheading Notes;

**Six-digit**
**Subheadings**

- A list of headings arranged in systematic order and, where appropriate, subdivided
into subheadings.

**THE GENERAL INTERPRETATIVE RULES**

To be completely sound, a classification system must associate each individual
product with a single heading (and, as the case may be, subheading), to which
that product can be simply and unequivocally assigned. Hence it must contain rules
designed to ensure that a given product is always classified in one and the same
heading (and subheading), to the exclusion of any others which might appear to
merit consideration. All classification decisions must be based upon the application
of these rules.

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

The text of the Harmonized System incorporates a
series of preliminary provisions codifying the principles
on which the System is based and which lays down
general rules to ensure uniform legal interpretation.

There are six of these rules, known as the "General
Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System"
and commonly referred to as the "GIRs", which are
applied in hierarchical fashion. The GIRs are explained
at the beginning of Volume 1 of the Explanatory Notes
to the Harmonized System, but the following overview
briefly explains their use and relationship.

**General Interpretative Rule 1 (GIR 1)** is the foremost
rule of classification. It specifies the elements that can
legally be used to classify products.

1.The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-Chapters
are provided for ease of reference only; for legal
purposes, classification shall be determined
according to the terms of the headings and any
relative Section or Chapter Notes and, provided
such headings or Notes do not otherwise require,
according to the following provisions.

The legal elements of classification are:

- the terms of headings;

- Section or Chapter Notes; and

- if not prevented by the two elements above, the
remaining General Interpretative Rules.

For legal purposes classification is determined by the
terms of the headings, the Section or Chapter Notes
where relevant, and, if necessary and allowable, the
other GIRs.

Where the terms of the headings and any relevant
Notes leave only one heading open for consideration,
or they direct either the classification or the means of
classification, then only GIR 1 is used at heading level.

**General Interpretative Rule 2 (GIR 2)** is in two parts.
It seeks to ensure that articles and products are not
left unclassifiable by reason of being incomplete,
unfinished, unassembled or disassembled, mixed or
made of multiple materials.

22 | World Customs Organization

2. (a) Any reference in a heading to an article shall
be taken to include a reference to that article
incomplete or unfinished, provided that,
as presented, the incomplete or unfinished
article has the essential character of the
complete or finished article. It shall also be
taken to include a reference to that article
complete or finished (or falling to be classified
as complete or finished by virtue of this Rule),
presented unassembled or disassembled.

The first part of GIR 2 (a), extends the scope of headings
which refers to articles to also cover such articles when
they are incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as
presented, they have the essential character of the
complete or finished articles. This does not extend
coverage to parts or subassemblies which are not yet
identifiable as having the essential character of the
complete finished articles.

The second part of GIR 2 (a), provides that complete
or finished articles presented unassembled or
disassembled, usually for reasons such as the
requirements or convenience of packing, handling or
transport, are to be classified in the same heading as
the assembled articles.

2. (b) Any reference in a heading to a material
or substance shall be taken to include a
reference to mixtures or combinations of that
material or substance with other materials
or substances. Any reference to goods of a
given material or substance shall be taken
to include a reference to goods consisting
wholly or partly of such material or substance.
The classification of goods consisting of
more than one material or substance shall be
according to the principles of Rule 3.

GIR 2 (b) covers products that are mixtures or
combinations of materials or articles made of more
than one material or substance. It extends the scope
of any heading referring to a material or substance
to include such mixtures, combinations or articles
which are partly made of that material or substance.
GIR 2 (b) does not classify products: it simply opens
the scope of headings to include such goods. Goods
covered by more than one heading because of this
General Interpretative Rule are classified according to
the principles of GIR 3.

**General Interpretative Rule 3 (GIR 3)** provides
classification principles for goods which, prima facie,
fall under two or more headings. It has three parts
which are applied sequentially until a classification is
determined.

3. When by application of Rule 2 (b) or for any
other reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable
under two or more headings, classification shall
be effected as follows:

(a) The heading which provides the most specific
description shall be preferred to headings
providing a more general description. However,
when two or more headings each refer to part
only of the materials or substances contained
in mixed or composite goods or to part only
of the items in a set put up for retail sale,
those headings are to be regarded as equally
specific in relation to those goods, even if
one of them gives a more complete or precise
description of the goods.

(b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of
different materials or made up o different
components, and goods put up in sets for
retail sale, which cannot be classified by
reference to Rule 3 (a), shall be classified as if
they consisted of the material or component
which gives them their essential character,
insofar as this criterion is applicable.

(c) When goods cannot be classified by reference
to Rule 3 (a) or 3 (b), they shall be classified
under the heading which occurs last in
numerical order among those which equally
merit consideration.

GIR 3 (a) stipulates that goods should be classified in the
heading giving the most specific description. However,
any headings which are opened by the provisions of
GIR 2 as covering part of the materials or substances
or any headings that are only open because they
cover a component or item in a composite good or set
are regarded as equally specific. So in practice, this
provision classifies where the good in its entirety is
covered by two or more headings.

GIR 3 (b) deals with mixtures, composite goods and
sets put up for retail sale. By application of this General

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

Interpretative Rule, goods are classified in the heading
applicable to the material or component which gives
them their essential character.

GIR 3 (c) applies only where goods cannot be classified
by application of GIR 3 (a) or GIR 3 (b); it provides that
goods should be classified in the heading which occurs
last in numerical order amongst those which equally
merit consideration in determining their classification.

Practically all goods are classified to a heading
by either GIR 1 or GIRs 1 and 3. However, to guard
against the possibility of something that is otherwise
unclassifiable, there is an extra rule relating to heading
classification.

**General Interpretative Rule 4 (GIR 4)** deals with goods
which (for example because they have just appeared
on the world market) are not covered by any heading
of the Harmonized System, even by the material that
they are made from. In the unlikely event it is needed,
this GIR provides for classification with the goods to
which are most similar in nature.

4. Goods which cannot be classified in accordance
with the above Rules shall be classified under the
heading appropriate to the goods to which they
are most akin.

**General Interpretative Rule 5 (GIR 5)** relates to
containers and packaging for goods. Few goods are
traded without being packed in some way. This leaves
the question of how to account for these packing
materials and containers.

5. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the
following Rules shall apply in respect of the
goods referred to therein:

(a) Camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun
cases, drawing instrument cases, necklace
cases and similar containers, specially shaped
or fitted to contain a specific article or set
of articles, suitable for long-term use and
presented with the articles for which they are
intended, shall be classified with such articles
when of a kind normally sold therewith. This
Rule does not, however, apply to containers
which give the whole its essential character.

World Customs Organization | 23

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

(b) Subject to the provisions of Rule 5 (a) above,
packing materials and packing containers
presented with the goods therein shall be
classified with the goods if they are of a
kind normally used for packing such goods.
However, this provision is not binding when
such packing materials or packing containers
are clearly suitable for repetitive use.

GIR 5 (a) governs the classification of cases, boxes
and similar containers presented with the articles
for which they are intended, while GIR 5 (b) applies
more generally to packing containers presented with
the goods they hold. It should be noted that the
application of GIR 5 (b) in respect of classification of
packing materials and containers suitable for repetitive
use is left to the discretion of countries, which may
take whatever measures they consider appropriate in
this area.

By the end of General Interpretative Rule 5, all goods,
and their containers and packaging, are classified to
heading level.

Finally, **General Interpretative Rule 6 (GIR 6)** requires
the whole process to be repeated again as a separate
exercise to choose the five-digit subheading and then
again for the six-digit subheading level as required.

6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods
in the subheadings of a heading shall be
determined according to the terms of those
subheadings and any related Subheading Notes
and, mutatis mutandis, to the above Rules, on
the understanding that only subheadings at the
same level are comparable. For the purpose of
this Rule the relative Section and Chapter Notes
also apply, unless the context otherwise requires.

In the classification procedure for the subheading
levels, classification is on the basis of the terms of
the subheadings and any relevant subheading Notes.
However, the General Interpretative Rules 1 to 5 and
any relevant Section and Chapter Notes still apply,
with the required changes (mutatis mutandis) to refer
to the subheading level being considered instead of
the headings.

24 | World Customs Organization

Subheading classification is done by comparing only
the subheadings of the same level that fall under the
heading (or subheading) previously determined. It
should be emphasized that at each step in the process,
no account is taken of the terms of any lower-level
subdivisions. This principle applies without exception
throughout the Harmonized System.

The General Interpretative Rules thus establish
classification principles which are applicable throughout
the Harmonized System Nomenclature. They provide a
step-by-step basis for the classification of goods within
the Harmonized System firstly at the 4-digit heading
level, then separately at each level below as required.

**SECTION AND CHAPTER NOTES, INCLUDING**
**SUBHEADING NOTES**

Certain Sections and Chapters are preceded by Notes
which, like the General Interpretative Rules, form an
integral part of the Harmonized System and have
the same legal force. Some of these Notes, grouped
under the title "Subheading Notes", refer solely to the
Interpretation of subheadings.

The function of these Notes is to define the precise
scope and limits of each subheading, heading (or
group of headings), Chapter or Section. This has been
achieved, depending on the circumstances, by the
following means.

**•** **DEFINITION**
This can be general definitions delineating the
scope of a subheading or heading or the meaning
of particular terms; for example sparkling wine
is defined by Subheading Note 1 to Chapter 22,
while legal Note 5 to Section XI gives a general
definition of the sewing thread of headings 52.04,
54.01 and 55.08 in terms of its appearance and
texture.

**•** **INCLUSION**
This can be by an exhaustive list of the goods
covered by a heading or group of headings or
a non-exhaustive list of typical examples. For
example, Notes 2, 3 and 4 to Chapter 31 together
provide an exhaustive list the products that fall to
be classified as fertilisers in headings 31.02, 31.03
and 31.04. In comparison, Note 3 to Chapter 86
specifies some of the railway and tramway track
fixtures and fittings covered by heading 86.08.

**•** **EXCLUSION**
Notes which list certain articles that must not
be included in a particular subheading, heading
(or group of headings), Chapters or Section are
common. For example, Note 2 to Chapter 64 lists
the articles which must not be regarded as parts
of footwear within the meaning of heading 64.06.

**•** **METHOD OF CLASSIFICATION**
There are Notes which prevent the use of General
Interpretative Rules 2 to 5 by directing the means
of classification where there is more than one
possible heading. For example, Note 7 to Section
XV directs that classification of composite articles
of two or more base metals are to be classified on
the basis of the metal contributing the greatest
weight, thereby over-riding the operation of GIR 3.

Certain Notes employ several of these drafting
formulae. The definition of "synthetic rubber" in Note
4 to Chapter 40 provides an example of a definition
in general terms, in accordance with scientific criteria,
followed by an enumeration of products which, within
the context of this definition, are to be taken as covered
by the definition.

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

Under GIR 6, the Section and Chapter Notes also
apply to the classification of goods in the subheadings
unless, of course, the context otherwise requires. This
is the case, for example, with Note 4 (B) to Chapter 71
(definition of the term "platinum"), which cannot apply
to subheadings 7110.11 and 7110.19, for which the term
"platinum" is more restrictively defined by Subheading
Note 2 to Chapter 71.

It would no doubt have been possible, at least in certain
cases, to incorporate the substance of these Notes in
the text of the headings or subheadings themselves.
But this would have greatly lengthened these texts,
making them difficult to understand, and would have
involved a great deal of repetition. The Notes thus
made it possible to draft the headings in concise form
while at the same time safeguarding the precision and
exactness of interpretation that are essential to avoid
doubts and disputes in classification.

**HEADINGS AND SUBHEADINGS OF THE HS**

In the Harmonized System, the headings (with their
subheadings) are arranged in 96 Chapters, which are
themselves grouped in 21 Sections.

As a general rule, goods are arranged in order of
their degree of manufacture: raw materials, unworked
products, semi-finished products, finished products.
For example, live animals fall in Chapter 1, animal
hides and skins, in Chapter 41, and leather footwear,
in Chapter 64. The same progression also exists within
the Chapters and headings.

Under GIR 1, the Chapter and Section titles are not
legally binding. They are provided for ease of reference
only, and have therefore been drawn up in concise and
very general terms.

## MAINTENANCE OF THE HS

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

**THE HARMONIZED SYSTEM COMMITTEE (HSC)**

Most of the problems involved in the application of a
Customs nomenclature are essentially questions of
classification. The appropriate heading or sub-heading
for each individual product has to be determined
on the basis of available technological data and by
application of the texts of the headings or subheadings,
the Section, Chapter or Subheading Notes, the General
Interpretative Rules and the relevant Explanatory
Notes.

In drafting the Harmonized System and its
complementary publications, it was obviously quite
impossible, in a field as vast and varied as that of a
goods nomenclature, to provide, for every possible
current and future contingency and to settle each such
possibility, in advance, in a manner so precise as to
obviate any subsequent doubt about the classification
of any particular product or article.

The General Interpretative Rules do of course lay down
guiding principles for classification purposes, but their
application may sometimes be a delicate matter.

For example, GIR 3 (b) provides, amongst other
things, that mixtures and composite goods, prima
facie classifiable under two or more headings, shall
be classified as if they consisted of that material or
component giving the product its essential character;
but this principle can give rise to very different results
according to the viewpoint of the person considering
the matter. Other provisions within the Notes and
terms talk about similarly subjective concepts and
classes such as 'principal function', 'purpose', 'toys'
and 'accessories'. Interpretation of many of the words
used to define classes of goods can be the subject of
disagreement between people, administrations and
judiciaries.

It may therefore sometimes happen that users of
nomenclatures based on the Harmonized System
will arrive at different decisions concerning the
classification of the same product.

It is the responsibility of the Harmonized System
Committee to take all necessary measures or to
make any necessary proposals to the Customs Cooperation Council to ensure the uniform interpretation
and application of the Harmonized System. The basic
powers and functions of the Committee are set out in
Articles 6 and 7 of the HS Convention.

World Customs Organization | 29

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

**1. Establishment of the Committee**

The HSC, composed of representatives from each
Contracting Party, was established in accordance with
Article 6 of the HS Convention. That is, Contracting
Parties to the HS Convention automatically become a
member of the Committee.

In the Committee, each Contracting Party has the
right to one vote. Nevertheless, for the purposes of
the HS Convention, where a Customs or Economic
Union as well as one or more of its Member States are
Contracting Parties, then those Contracting Parties
can together exercise only one vote. At present,
this provision concerns the European Union and its
Member States.

In 1988, the HSC, as its first task, drew up its Rules of
Procedure in accordance with Article 6.6 of the HS
Convention, and submitted them to the Council for
approval. The Council, at its 71 [st] /72 [nd] Sessions, approved
the Rules of Procedure of the HSC. Consequently, the
Rules of Procedure of the HSC are essentially based on
the HS Convention.

The HSC normally meets at least twice a year at the
Headquarters of the Council. Members of the Council
which are not Contracting Parties to the HS Convention
may also be represented at meetings of the HSC as
observers with the right to take part in the discussions
but not to vote. Where appropriate, the Committee
invites other intergovernmental or international
organizations to participate as observers in its work.

Decisions concerning amendments to the HS
Convention are taken by a majority of not less than
two-thirds of the votes cast by the Members of the
HSC. Other decisions are taken by a simple majority of
the votes cast by the Members of the HSC.

**2. Role of the Committee**

According to Articles 7.1 (Functions of the HSC) and 10
(Settlement of disputes) of the HS Convention, the HSC
plays the following major roles:

-  Ensuring the uniform interpretation and application
of the Harmonized System;

-  Settlement of disputes between Contracting
Parties with regard to the classification of goods
in the HS;

30 | World Customs Organization

-  Continuous updating of the HS, taking into
account changes in technology or in patterns of
international trade.

**Ensuring the uniform interpretation and application**
**of the HS**

One of the most important roles of the HSC is to take
all necessary measures or to make any necessary
proposals to the Council to ensure the uniform
interpretation and application of the System.

Article 7.1 of the HS Convention stipulates the functions
necessary to fulfil this role of the HSC as follows:

-  To prepare Explanatory Notes, Classification
Opinions or other advice as guides to the
interpretation of the Harmonized System;

-   To prepare recommendations to secure uniformity
in the interpretation and application of the
Harmonized System;

-  To collate and circulate information concerning the
application of the Harmonized System;

-  On its own initiative or on request, to furnish
information or guidance on any matters concerning
the classification of goods in the Harmonized
System to Contracting Parties, to Members of the
Council and to such intergovernmental or other
international organizations as the Committee may
consider appropriate.

In carrying out these functions, the Committee in its
meetings examines a series of technical and general
questions and decides on the action to be taken
thereafter.

**Questions handled and form of decisions taken by**
**the Committee**

**a) Technical questions**

In most cases, technical questions (classification
questions) are raised by Contracting Parties to the
HS Convention. However, the Committee may also be
called upon to deal with questions submitted by other
countries or by organizations (e.g., intergovernmental
or non-governmental international organizations
representing particular trades or industries).

**Harmonized System**

In addition, the Committee may be invited to consider
classification questions identified by the Secretariat
during the course of its work or which have been raised
by national or international governmental or nongovernmental organizations or by private concerns
and which the Secretariat itself has been unable to
resolve in correspondence with the administrations or
organizations concerned.

Many classification questions are first examined by
the Secretariat (Nomenclature and Classification SubDirectorate of the Tariff and Trade Affairs
Directorate). The Secretariat examines them, based on
documentation and samples, and advises appropriate
classification. For the most part, these classification
questions are resolved in correspondence with the
administrations or organizations concerned.

If administrations or organizations ask for classification
questions to be examined by the HSC, the Secretariat
then refers the questions, supported by necessary
documentation and samples, where available, and
normally a note setting out its own conclusions, for
consideration by the HSC, which then decides on
appropriate action after comparing the views and
arguments of Member delegations and the Secretariat.

The action taken following the examination of a
classification question is likely to vary according to the
type of case:

-  where the classification is already clearly
established by the Harmonized System text or
the Explanatory Notes and hence does not raise
any new or unusual difficulties, the Committee
may simply mention the classification decision in
the Report on the Committee session at which the
question was examined;

-  in cases where, although classification can be
established under the terms of the Harmonized
System or the Explanatory Notes, the question
raises new or unusual difficulties, the Committee
may issue a Classification Opinion;

-  if it is found that the Explanatory Notes do not
provide specifically for the resolution of the
problem, the Committee may amend or amplify
the Explanatory Notes;

-  if the classification decision necessitated by the
existing Harmonized System texts is not considered
by the Committee to be the most appropriate for

32 | World Customs Organization

the goods concerned, the Committee may then
propose to the Council that the Nomenclature
be amended, corresponding amendments, if
necessary, being made to the Explanatory Notes.

According to Rule 21 of the Rules of Procedure of the
HSC, the Council Secretariat performs the secretarial
work in connection with meetings of the Committee
and circulates communications to the Members of the
Committee concerning items on the Agenda of such
meetings, prepares the working documents and draws
up the reports of the meetings.

Documents and reports are presented in the form of
proposals for the amendment of the Convention, the
Explanatory Notes and/or Classification Opinions or
proposals for Recommendations to secure uniformity
in the interpretation and application of the HS.

**b) General questions**

The HSC also normally examines a series of general
questions that are not directly related to the HS
Nomenclature, but certainly provide valuable
assistance with regard to the uniform application and
maintenance of the HS.

General questions that may be raised include, among
other matters: the use, and promotion of the HS; the
running of the Committee; improvement of processes,
including Recommendations on necessary or desirable
amendments to the Convention; co-operation or
involvement with other internal and external bodies
(including the private sector); the content, preparation
and distribution of publications and surveys or research
on HS related matters.

**THE HS REVIEW SUB-COMMITTEE (RSC)**

The Council set up the HS Review Sub Committee (RSC)
to work on the drafting of updates to the Harmonized
System. The RSC consists of representatives of
Contracting Parties to the HS Convention and any
Member of the Council which is not a Contracting
Party to that Convention. In addition, the Secretary
General may invite, representatives of States which
are not Members of the Council, representatives of
any relevant intergovernmental or other international
organizations, and any experts whose participation is
considered desirable on the basis of the contribution
they might be expected to make to the work of the
RSC.

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

The RSC is responsible for ensuring the systematic review of the Nomenclature,
as envisaged by Article 7.1 (a) of the HS Convention, by considering and drafting
proposals for amendments with a view to presenting to the HSC reviewed and welldrafted proposals. Proposals may be sent directly to the RSC or be referred for
consideration from the HSC.

The RSC holds its sessions as and when required and subject to approval by the
HSC and the WCO Council. In practice, it holds two sessions a year, which are held
approximately two months after the HSC meetings to enable work arising from
those meetings to be addressed.

The RSC works on a consensus basis and reports to the HSC. If agreement cannot
be reached on a question, then the differing views, together with their supporting
rationales, are also reported.

According to Rule 1 (Functions) of its Rules of Procedure, the RSC also prepares, to
the extent appropriate, any consequential amendments to the Explanatory Notes
for consideration by the HSC, in addition to the review of the Harmonized System.

The first general review of the Harmonized System by the RSC was completed in 1993
and entered into force on 1 January 1996. The following reviews were implemented
in 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017. At the time of publication, work was proceeding for
2022.

**THE SCIENTIFIC SUB-COMMITTEE (SSC)**

The Scientific Sub-Committee (SSC), is an advisory body of the WCO Council
on questions involving chemical or other scientific matters. It mainly consists of
representatives of the Customs laboratory services of Council Members. The HSC
and the RSC are often assisted in their most technical work (in particular, questions

involving the classification of chemical products) by the SSC. The SSC holds its
sessions as and when required and subject to approval by the Council. It normally
holds at least one session a year in January.

The SSC seeks to reach agreed views on any matter examined and reports them
to the Council or the relevant Committee, as appropriate. If agreement cannot be
reached on a question, the differing views together with their supporting rationales
are also reported.

**WORKING PARTIES**

Article 6 of the HS Convention stipulates that the HSC shall set up Sub-Committees
or Working Parties as needed, having regard, in particular, to the provisions of
paragraph 1 (a) of Article 7. Currently, the presessional Working Party of the HSC has
the responsibility of finalizing the texts of possible amendments to the Nomenclature,
the Explanatory Notes, and the Compendium of Classification Opinions before their
adoption by the HSC.

## AMENDING THE HS

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

A goods nomenclature cannot be an absolutely rigid
instrument. It is designed to serve as a framework
for international trade and other needs, which are
themselves in constant evolution, and must therefore
be kept abreast of current requirements. Also, the
success of the Harmonized System depends to a great
extent on how far requirements of present and future
users are met. It is also important that the definitions
and descriptions of the legal notes, headings and
subheadings reflect the actual situation in trade and
production.

These imperatives are of particular relevance to the
Harmonized System, because it provides a systematic
and methodical classification of goods based essentially
on technological data. Such a classification system is
of use only if it is kept in step with technical progress.
Paragraph 1 (a) of Article 7 of the HS Convention clearly
specifies this role of the HSC.

In some cases, these objectives might be achieved
by amending the Explanatory Notes alone. However,
amending the Explanatory Notes alone, does not alter
the scope of the headings/sub-headings concerned.
There are, sometimes, cases when legal texts need
to be amended. In such cases, it is expected that the
Harmonized System itself be amended in accordance
with the procedure laid down in Article 16 of the HS
Convention.

Amendment under the same procedure may also be
required to clarify the application of the System or
for the purposes of its simplification, consequential
amendments being made as necessary to the
Explanatory Notes and Classification Opinions. In
either event, after an amendment has come into force
or has been accepted, no government may accede
to the Harmonized System Convention unless it also
accepts that amendment.

Article 16 of the Convention states that the starting
point for the time periods specified in that Article are
the dates on which the Secretary General of the Council
notifies Contracting Parties of the recommended
amendment. Contracting Parties have six months,
starting from that date, to indicate any objections to
the amendment. If no objections are outstanding at the
end of this period, the amendment is deemed to have
been accepted.

World Customs Organization | 35

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

However, Contracting Parties need time to finalize all the legal and regulatory
procedures for the amendment of their own tariffs or statistical nomenclatures.
Therefore, accepted amendments enter into force usually 2.5 years after the
notification of the recommended amendments to administrations.

The important issue here is that Contracting Parties should pay attention to the
timely implementation of amendments to the HS when they are due. They have to
update their national tariff accordingly. In the past, some Contracting Parties have
had problems with implementing amendments to the HS for several reasons such as
from simple negligence to the complicated nature of national legislative procedures.

The first set of Article 16 amendments to the Harmonized System (see the Council's
Recommendation of July 1989) became effective for all Contracting Parties on
1 January 1992. The second set of Article 16 amendments, which was the first
comprehensive set of amendments (see the Council's Recommendation of July
1993), entered into force on 1 January 1996. The third set of amendments, which
is also a comprehensive set, (see the Council's Recommendation of June 1999),
entered into force on 1 January 2002. The fourth set of amendments, which is also
a comprehensive set, (see the Council's Recommendation of June 2004), enters in
force on 1 January 2007. The fifth set of amendments, which is also a comprehensive
set, (see the Council's Recommendation of June 2009), entered into force on
1 January 2012. The sixth set of amendments, which is also a comprehensive set,
(see the Council's Recommendation of June 2014), entered in force on 1 January
2017.

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

In this connection, as the history of the development of the Harmonized System has
already shown, it will be of paramount importance that close contact be maintained
between the Harmonized System Committee and the many and varied organizations
whose interests are served by the System and whose expertise will undoubtedly be
of considerable value in ensuring that the System continues to reflect the needs of
its users and any changes in technology or in patterns of international trade.

At the time of publication, the current review is due to be implemented on 1 January
2022. This means that all amendments must be finalised well before this time to
allow for the implementation process.

World Customs Organization | 37

**Harmonized System**

## DISPUTE SETTLEMENT

**GENERAL POINTS**

Another important task assigned to the Harmonized System Committee is the
settlement of disputes between Contracting Parties with regard to the classification
of goods in the Harmonized System (see Article 10 of the HS Convention).

Where a dispute arises between two or more Contracting Parties regarding the
interpretation or application of the Harmonized System, the parties concerned
should, in the first instance, endeavour to reach agreement among themselves.
Administrations which have resolved such questions by direct negotiation may
advise the Secretariat and then the Secretariat may inform the HS Committee of the
solution adopted.

However, classification disputes which cannot be settled by direct negotiation are
referred through the Secretariat to the Committee, which, after examination, makes
appropriate recommendations for their solution. If the Committee is unable to settle
a dispute, it refers the matter to the Council for a recommendation on the question.
In either event, the Parties to a dispute may agree in advance to accept the
recommendations of the Committee or the Council as binding.

38 | World Customs Organization

Where classification divergences are brought
directly to the attention of the Secretariat, the facts
are confirmed by consulting the Contracting Parties
concerned. If it is found that there is a real divergence
of opinion, the matter is referred to the Committee in
accordance with the normal procedure.

The Harmonized System was designed to be as user
friendly as possible in its application. The publication of
the HS Explanatory Notes, HS Commodity Data Base
and other HS-related material is one WCO initiative
aimed at making the system user friendly. However,
the HS still remains a complex system which may often
lead to differences regarding the interpretation of its
provisions. Some of these differences are fuelled by the
different needs of the users, while others are a result
of genuine difficulties encountered in its interpretation.
Certain Customs decisions, for example, are contested
by the trade community and, conversely, Customs
often contests classification decisions made by the
trade community.

Such conflicts cost both government and the trade
community a great deal of time and money. These
conflicts can arise at the various stages e.g., the preentry classification stage, the declaration-processing
stage or the post-entry stage. If a dispute arises at
the pre-entry stage and is dealt with at that time, it
will help avoid future conflicts. If, however, most of the
classification checks are performed at the declarationprocessing stage and conflicts arise at that stage, a
great deal of time and money will be lost in the process
of resolving disputes.

Irrespective of the stage at which a dispute might occur,
it is necessary to have an appropriate mechanism for
resolving conflicts as quickly as possible.

There are basically two procedures for settling
classification disputes:

- Informal (consultation); and

- Formal.

The WCO recommends that a combination of
consultation and formal procedures be clearly outlined
by law as a fair means of solving classification disputes.

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

**INFORMAL PROCEDURE: CONSULTATION WITH**
**IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS**

The consultation procedure is applicable at all stages.
Communication with the importer or exporter on
findings of Customs and points requiring clarification
will frequently resolve issues. Final decisions by
Customs should only be made after traders have been
given a chance to explain (either orally or in writing and
in a reasonable timeframe) their point of view.

If a dispute is handled within the Customs
administration, a unit or office which is different from
the original unit or office processing the declaration
should deal with the matter.
Importers should be made aware of the formal appeals
procedure and their ability to resort to the judicial
system if they are not satisfied with the Customs
decision.

Apart from co-ordination, dispute settlement
procedures should ensure speedy, objective and
efficient handling of disputes. Not only will this enable
Customs to resolve most classification problems fairly
and quickly, but it will also reduce the costs that might
arise if matters take a long time to be resolved.

**FORMAL PROCEDURE**

Matters should normally be referred to courts of law
only if the internal mechanisms fail to resolve the issue.
Justice demands that recourse to courts of law should
be an option for importers or exporters aggrieved
by Customs. This is a fundamental principle of fair
treatment for the business community and should be
encouraged by Customs.

The formal appeals procedure should be clearly
outlined, and legal requirements and procedures
should be explained to the trade community. The first
appeal may be to a designated departmental authority
whereas the second appeal or further appeals should
be to independent judicial authorities.

Headquarters or the classification centre should provide
all necessary background or technical information at
its disposal to such authorities upon request.

## THE HS SIXTH EDITION (2017)

40 | World Customs Organization

The 2017 edition is the fifth major revision of the HS.
It includes 233 sets of amendments to the
Nomenclature. The list of all amendments is available
on the WCO's website, but below are some examples
of areas which were addressed.

**Environmental and social issues of global concern:**
The majority of these changes to the HS were prompted
by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations). These include amendments for fish
and fishery products, the objective being to further
enhance the coverage of species and product forms
which need to be monitored for food security purposes
and for better management of resources.

**Monitoring:** HS 2017 also features certain classification
provisions introduced in order to monitor trade in
products such as substances controlled under the
Chemical Weapons Convention, hazardous chemicals
controlled under the Rotterdam Convention, and
persistent organic pollutants controlled under the
Stockholm Convention.

There is also a focus on forestry products, with the
aim being to enhance the coverage of wood species
to obtain a better picture of trade patterns, including
trade in endangered species.

**Technological progress:** New provisions such as multicomponent integrated circuits (MCOs) as defined in new
Note 9 (b) (iv) to Chapter 85 help keep the HS relevant
to today's goods. MCOs are advanced semiconductor
devices that combine integrated circuits and discrete
components into a single package manufactured using
semiconductor technology.

Other amendments resulted from changes in
international trade patterns, manufacturing processes,
as well as efforts to simplify the HS.

## THE EXPLANATORY NOTES

To complement the legal core, there are Explanatory Notes to the HS published
separately by the WCO. While these notes do not form part of the legal provisions
of the HS, it is important that they be consulted during the classification process as
they provide commentary on the intent and scope of provisions. As approved by
the Customs Co-operation Council, they constitute the official interpretation of the
Harmonized System at the International level and are an indispensable complement
to the System.

It will always be useful and sometimes essential to refer to them in order to
ascertain the correct interpretation of the System itself, and in this context it might
be noted that the equivalent Explanatory Notes to the CCCN had been unilaterally
incorporated by a number of countries into their domestic legal systems (by means,
for example, of a Regulation). However, it must be borne in mind that the Explanatory
Notes are not an exhaustive, unchangeable commentary on the overall scope of the
headings and subheadings of the Harmonized System; they must always be read
in strict conformity with the texts of the System itself, from which they cannot be
dissociated, and in particular with the General Interpretative Rules and the Section,
Chapter and Subheading Notes.

The 1978 edition of the CCCN Explanatory Notes was found to be very useful in
preparing the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized System. However, during
the course of the examination of these Notes, it was recognized that significant
areas would have to be brought up-to-date, both to take account of the more
comprehensive structure of the Harmonized System and to reflect the considerable
technological progress made since the Notes last underwent major revision.

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

Thus, the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized System follow the systematic order
of that instrument. They provide a commentary on the scope of each heading, giving a
list of the main products included and excluded, together with technical descriptions
of the goods concerned (their appearance, properties, method of production and
uses) and practical guidance for their identification. Where appropriate, Explanatory
Notes also clarify the scope of particular subheadings.

## THE COMPENDIUM OF CLASSIFICATION OPINIONS

The Compendium of Classification Opinions includes a list of the most significant and
difficult classification decisions taken by the Harmonized System Committee and
adopted by the Customs Co-operation Council, set out in the order of the headings
and sub-headings of the HS Nomenclature.

Although the Compendium does not form an integral part of the Harmonized System
Convention, it is a useful tool to assist with the classification in the Harmonized
System.

The Interim Harmonized System Committee and the Nomenclature Committee agreed
that some of the Classification Opinions contained in the CCCN Compendium of
Classification Opinions would continue to be useful in the context of the Harmonized
System. The Committees therefore decided to examine the CCCN Compendium
and to publish certain of those opinions (with the necessary HS modifications) as
a Compendium of Harmonized System Classification Opinions. The Committees
also agreed to include in the HS Compendium certain new Classification Opinions
agreed to by the two Committees during the period June 1983 to June 1987. The
HS Compendium was approved by the Council in June 1987 and was published in
late 1987.

Since the first edition, the HS Compendium has been regularly amended to include
new classification decisions by the Harmonized System Committee. The new edition
of the HS Compendium relating to the HS 2017 edition incorporates all previous
amending supplements adopted by the Committee.

## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

**Harmonized System**
30 Years On

The HS is a living document. Unlike many international
instruments, it has a clear and relatively simple process
for amendment to keep it up-to-date and relevant.
This type of incremental improvement will of course
continue. Yet, the expectation of the international
trading community remains high for a speedier
decision-making process and binding HS decisions to
give answers and certainty to business.

There is another factor that will play an important
part of the HS's future. With the help of information
technology, we are able to analyse and use data and
information with a scope and sophistication that has
never before been matched. And yet the usefulness
of that information is dependent on the quantity and
quality of data we can feed into the process. The crucial
role that the HS plays in providing data on world trade
ensures that its importance will only grow with time.
Trade is vital to economies and information on what is
traded internationally informs policy areas as diverse
as economics, security, health and wellbeing, political
stability, environment and resource management to
name just a few.

With this importance to both current research and
analysis and the future uses which advanced analytics
will be able to develop for trade data, the need to
continue to nurture the HS and look towards its future
developments has never been stronger.

**Harmonized System**

A tariff classification nomenclature enables uniform
and consistent identification of traded goods for the
## CONCLUSION
purposes of duty and tax collection and enforcement
of national laws.

An internationally harmonized tariff classification
nomenclature builds the basis for the simplified
implementation of international treaties, analysis
of global trade for economic, policy and business
planning, and international trade negotiations. It also
supports seamless end-to-end integrated international
transactions, facilitating trade and development.

Therefore, the Harmonized System is not only one of
the major instruments and success stories of the World
Customs Organization. It is a critical and essential tool
of Customs in a global context.
