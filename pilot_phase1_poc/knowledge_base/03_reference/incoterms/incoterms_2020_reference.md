## Incoterms Selection Guide for Singapore Shippers

### For Exports from Singapore

| Scenario | Recommended Term |
|----------|------------------|
| Buyer arranges all transport | **EXW** or **FCA** (seller's premises) |
| Container shipments | **FCA** (port/container yard) |
| Seller controls shipping, buyer insures | **CPT** or **CFR** |
| Seller controls shipping and insurance | **CIP** or **CIF** |
| Full door-to-door service | **DAP** or **DDP** |

### For Imports to Singapore

| Scenario | Recommended Term |
|----------|------------------|
| Control shipping costs | **FOB** or **FCA** (origin) |
| Supplier arranges freight | **CFR** or **CPT** |
| Supplier covers insurance | **CIF** or **CIP** |
| Door delivery, handle own customs | **DAP** |
| Complete delivered cost | **DDP** |

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using FOB/CIF for containers**: Use FCA/CIP instead - risk passes at container yard, not ship's rail
2. **EXW for international sales**: Seller may face export clearance issues; use FCA
3. **DDP without capability**: Ensure seller can actually clear imports in buyer's country
4. **Ignoring insurance**: Under CPT/CFR, buyer bears risk but may forget to insure
5. **Wrong named place**: Be specific - "Singapore" is not enough; use "PSA Container Terminal, Singapore"

---

## Incoterms and Singapore Customs

### GST Implications

| Incoterm | GST Base (for imports) |
|----------|------------------------|
| CIF/CIP | Invoice value (includes insurance) |
| CFR/CPT | Invoice value + insurance (if any) |
| FOB/FCA | Invoice value + freight + insurance |
| EXW | Invoice value + all costs to Singapore |
| DDP | Not applicable (duties paid by seller) |

### Customs Value Determination

Singapore Customs uses CIF value for duty/GST calculation:
- **CIF Value** = Cost + Insurance + Freight to Singapore

For non-CIF terms, adjust by adding freight and insurance to arrive at CIF equivalent.
