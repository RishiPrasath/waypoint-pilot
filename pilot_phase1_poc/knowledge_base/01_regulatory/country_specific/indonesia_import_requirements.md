# Indonesia Import Requirements

## Overview

Indonesia's import regulations are managed by the Directorate General of Customs and Excise (DGCE/Bea Cukai) under the Ministry of Finance. The country has implemented the Online Single Submission (OSS) system and Indonesia National Single Window (INSW) to streamline import processes.

## Key Regulatory Bodies

| Agency | Indonesian Name | Responsibility |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Directorate General of Customs and Excise | Bea Cukai | Customs clearance, duties |
| Ministry of Trade | Kemendag | Import licensing, trade policy |
| Ministry of Industry | Kemenperin | Industrial standards (SNI) |
| BPOM | Badan POM | Food, drugs, cosmetics registration |
| Ministry of Agriculture | Kementan | Agricultural products, quarantine |

## Required Import Documentation

At a minimum, import documentation must include:

1. **Proforma Invoice**
2. **Commercial Invoice**
3. **Certificate of Origin** (for preferential tariff claims)
4. **Bill of Lading or Airway Bill**
5. **Packing List**
6. **Insurance Certificate**

### Electronic Submission

Documents must be submitted electronically through the **Indonesia National Single Window (INSW)** platform using standardized Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) formats. Submissions typically occur prior to cargo arrival.

## Import Identification Number (API)

All importers must hold a valid **Import Identification Number (API)** and the appropriate import license.

### Business Identification Number (NIB)

Under the Omnibus Law on Job Creation and Government Regulation No. 29 of 2021, various import licenses have been consolidated into a single **Business Identification Number (Nomor Induk Berusaha or NIB)**, obtained through Indonesia's Online Single Submission (OSS) system.

The NIB now serves as a unified substitute for:
- **API-U** (General Import License)
- **API-P** (Producer Import License)
- **API-T** (Limited Import License)

## LARTAS (Prohibited & Restricted Goods)

LARTAS = **Larangan dan Pembatasan** (Prohibitions and Restrictions)

The importation of specific goods is strictly regulated under the **Prohibited and Restricted Goods (LARTAS) list**, as specified in **Ministry of Trade Regulation No. 18 of 2021**.

### Checking LARTAS Status

Importers are required to consult the **INSW portal** (eservice.insw.go.id) to identify any applicable restrictions or prohibitions for their goods.

### Regulatory Agencies for LARTAS
