# Singapore Import Procedures

## Overview

An import involves bringing goods into Singapore's customs territory from an entry point or a Free Trade Zone (FTZ). When importing goods for local consumption, you must declare them to Singapore Customs.

**Tax obligations:**
- **Non-dutiable goods**: GST payable
- **Dutiable goods**: Both GST and duty payable

## Duty and GST Payment Status

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| **Suspended** | Goods remain in FTZ or Customs-licensed premises |
| **Payable** | Goods released for local circulation |
| **Exempt** | Goods granted duty exemption, GST relief, or imported under approved schemes |

### Approved Schemes for Exemption
- Temporary Import Scheme
- Major Exporter Scheme (MES)
- Import GST Deferment Scheme (IGDS)

## Seven-Step Import Process

### Step 1: Register for UEN and Activate Customs Account

All entities engaging in import activities must:
1. Obtain a Unique Entity Number (UEN) from the appropriate agency
2. Activate a Customs Account through TradeNet

### Step 2: Check if Goods are Controlled

Verify whether your goods require special authorization from Competent Authorities:
- Use the HS code search tool
- Classification rulings available for **S$75** per product if needed

### Step 3: Apply for Inter-Bank GIRO

Maintain an Inter-Bank GIRO (IBG) with Singapore Customs for direct payment of:
- Duties
- Taxes
- Fees

### Step 4: Furnish Security

Provide security for transactions involving dutiable goods or licensed premises operation.

**Acceptable forms:**
- Banker's Guarantee
- Finance Company Guarantee
- Insurance Bond

### Step 5: Obtain Customs Import Permit

Submit applications via TradeNet through:
- Approved software vendors
- Government Front-End Application

**Note**: Permits have validity periods that must be observed.

### Step 6: Prepare Documents for Cargo Clearance

#### Containerized Cargo by Sea
No printed permit documentation required at checkpoint.

#### Air or Land Containerized Cargo
Present customs permit with supporting documents:
- Invoices
- Packing lists
- Bills of Lading / Air Waybills

#### Conventional Cargo
Provide printed permit and supporting documents at checkpoint verification.

#### GST-Relieved Air Imports
Non-controlled, non-dutiable items under **S$400 CIF value** can use summary lists instead of individual permits.

### Step 7: Retain Trade Documents

**Retention period**: **5 years** from permit approval date

**Storage options:**
- Physical copies
- Digital images

Documents must be available for Singapore Customs inspection.

## Key Documentation Requirements

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Customs import permit | Authorization to import |
| Commercial invoices | Valuation |
| Packing lists | Cargo details |
| Bill of Lading / Air Waybill | Transport documentation |
| Competent Authority permits | Controlled goods (if applicable) |
| Certificate of Origin | Preferential rates (when required) |

## Important Notes

- **Partial clearance** of containerized goods is **not permitted** at Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints
- Same customs permit must be presented for endorsement until complete clearance
- Declaring agents can be appointed to handle permit applications (may charge additional service fees)
