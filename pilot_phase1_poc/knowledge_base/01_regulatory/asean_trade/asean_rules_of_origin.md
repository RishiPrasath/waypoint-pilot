# ASEAN Rules of Origin Summary

## Overview

Rules of Origin (ROO) under ATIGA determine whether goods qualify for preferential tariff treatment when traded between ASEAN Member States. Products must meet specific origin criteria to benefit from the nearly tariff-free ASEAN market.

## Why Rules of Origin Matter

- Prevent non-ASEAN goods from receiving preferential treatment
- Ensure economic benefits remain within ASEAN
- Promote regional value chains and manufacturing
- Combat trade deflection and circumvention

## General Origin Criteria

To qualify as ASEAN-originating, goods must meet ONE of the following criteria:

### 1. Wholly Obtained or Produced
Goods entirely obtained or produced in one or more ASEAN Member States:
- Mineral products extracted from ASEAN soil/waters
- Agricultural goods harvested in ASEAN
- Animals born and raised in ASEAN
- Products from ASEAN hunting, fishing, or aquaculture
- Goods manufactured entirely from wholly obtained materials

### 2. Regional Value Content (RVC)
Goods must have a minimum **40% ASEAN content**:

```
RVC = (FOB Price - Value of Non-Originating Materials) / FOB Price × 100
```

**Threshold**: RVC ≥ 40%

### 3. Change in Tariff Classification (CTC)
Non-originating materials must undergo sufficient transformation:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| CC (Chapter Change) | Change at 2-digit HS level |
| CTH (Heading Change) | Change at 4-digit HS level |
| CTSH (Subheading Change) | Change at 6-digit HS level |

### 4. Product-Specific Rules (PSR)
Certain products have specific origin requirements defined in ATIGA Annex 3.

## ASEAN Cumulation

### Full Cumulation
- Materials originating in any ASEAN Member State are treated as originating
- Allows regional supply chains to contribute to origin

### Partial Cumulation
- Non-originating materials with some ASEAN processing can contribute proportionally to RVC
- Minimum 20% value added in exporting Member State

## Minimal Operations (Non-Qualifying)

The following do NOT confer origin:
- Preserving operations (drying, freezing, salt)
- Simple packaging/repackaging
- Affixing marks, labels, logos
- Simple mixing
- Simple assembly
- Slaughter of animals
- Dilution with water
- Ironing or pressing textiles

## Certificate of Origin Form D

### What is Form D?
The official ATIGA Certificate of Origin required to claim preferential tariffs.

### Issuing Authorities
Each ASEAN Member State has designated authorities:

| Country | Issuing Authority |
|---------|-------------------|
| Singapore | Singapore Customs |
| Malaysia | Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) |
| Indonesia | Ministry of Trade |
| Thailand | Department of Foreign Trade |
| Vietnam | Ministry of Industry and Trade |
| Philippines | Bureau of Customs |

### Form D Validity
- Valid from date of issuance
- Must be presented at time of import

## Self-Certification (AWSC)

### ASEAN-Wide Self-Certification Scheme
Certified exporters can self-declare origin status without obtaining Form D.

**Requirements to be Certified Exporter:**
- Demonstrate knowledge of ROO
- Good compliance track record
- Registered with national customs authority

**Benefits:**
- Faster processing
- Reduced costs
- No need to obtain CO for each shipment

**Implementation**: All ASEAN Member States (since 20 September 2020)

## Key RVC Thresholds

| Scenario | Minimum RVC |
|----------|-------------|
| General Rule | 40% |
| Partial Cumulation (Exporting State) | 20% |
| Textile Products | Specific rules apply |
| Automotive | Specific rules apply |

## Verification and Compliance

### Exporter Obligations
- Maintain records for **5 years**
- Provide documentation upon request
- Ensure accuracy of origin declarations

### Importer Obligations
- Present valid Form D or Origin Declaration
- Pay applicable duties if origin cannot be verified
- Cooperate with customs verification

### Verification Process
1. Importing customs may request verification
2. Exporting authority responds within specified timeframe
3. Preferential treatment may be denied if:
   - No response received
   - Information insufficient
   - Goods do not meet ROO

## Common ROO Compliance Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Insufficient RVC | Review supply chain; source more ASEAN materials |
| Wrong HS classification | Verify classification with customs |
| Incomplete documentation | Maintain proper records |
| Missing Form D | Obtain before shipment or use AWSC |

## Resources

### Sub-Committee on ATIGA Rules of Origin (SC-AROO)
- Monitors ROO implementation
- Reviews and updates PSRs
- Addresses interpretation issues

### Tools
- **ASEAN Tariff Finder**: Check ROO requirements by HS code
- **ASEAN Trade Repository**: Access ROO regulations by country
